$(P The D Language Foundation employs two part-time pull-request managers thanks
to the sponsorship of Symmetry Investments. One of them is intended to fill an
administrative/managerial role, the other a more technically-oriented role. This
document outlines their general responsibilities in managing the pull requests
submitted to $(LINK2 https://github.com/dlang, the D Programming Language Github
organization repositories), and the issues submitted to $(LINK2
https://issues.dlang.org/, issues.dlang.org).)

$(P The primary goal for the creation of these positions is to streamline the
contribution process. We are grateful to the volunteers who have been doing the
work of maintaining our Issue and PR queues over the past several years, but the
loose nature of our process has been such that too many contributions grow stale
(no one takes an interest, they become bottlenecked on one maintainer, etc).
Contributors should have confidence that their submissions, be they bug reports
or content contributions, will be reviewed and shepherded to a conclusion
without languishing for long periods of time. With paid staff overseeing the
process, we expect the process will become more efficient, and contributors will
have a primary point of contact to assist with tracking and resolving their
contributions.)

$(P The following list is divided into Administrative and Technical
responsibilities. Some may overlap, and there may be loose boundaries between
others. We trust the PR managers to establish their own approach to carrying out
these responsibilities.)

$(P In the text below, $(B APR) refers the Administrative PR Manager Role, $(B
TPR) refers to the Technical PR Manager Role.)

$(H2 Administrative Responsibilities)
$(P In order to effectively carry out his responsibilities, the APR needs to be
aware of which core contributors are responsible for which areas and which
community members to contact when necessary to resolve issues, and have an
understanding of the general direction the language and ecosystem are going
(i.e., for any given PR, the APR should be able to answer the question, "Do we
do this?").)

$(UL
    $(LI $(B Maintain the contribution guide) - $(LINK2
    https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, the contribution
    guide) establishes best practices for submitting issues and pull requests. The
    APR should work with the TPR to evolve these details as needed and ensure the
    document is up to date.)
    $(LI $(B Triage issues and PRs) - ensure that each issue report is properly
    prioritized and, where possible, assigned to someone who can resolve it;
    establish criteria to ensure that pull requests get as much time as they
    need for a proper review before being merged (e.g., trivial vs. complex,
    routine vs. controversial, etc); establish criteria to close issues/PRs;
    recognize when a pull request should first be incorporated as a DIP; etc.)
    $(LI $(B Keep track of progress) - the APR should establish some means of
    keeping up to date on the status of every issue and PR in our system, and
    will be the primary point of contact for queries about the status of any
    issue or PR.)
    $(LI $(B Communicate with relevant parties) - communication is vital to
    ensuring the efficient handling of issues and pull requests. Contributors
    will need to be sought out to resolve issues that are not picked up
    voluntarily; non-trivial pull requests will need to be reviewed by an
    appropriate core contributor/maintainer; contributors will need to be kept
    abreast of the status of their contributions when they cannot be resolved
    quickly; etc.)
)

$(H2 Technical Responsibilities)
$(P In order to effectively carry out the responsibilities of this role, the TPR
needs a solid understanding of the architecture of our GitHub projects (i.e.,
for any given PR, the TPR should be able to answer the question, "Can we do
this?").)

$(UL
    $(LI $(B Ensure compliance with contribution guide) - each issue and pull
    request should meet the guidelines established in $(LINK2
    https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, the contribution
    guide). The TPR will work with contributors to ensure these guidelines are
    met (reduced test cases, proper commit message format, changelog entries,
    resolve merge conflicts, etc).)
    $(LI $(B Identify and resolve regressions) - sometimes bugs are reported
    that are regressions, but not marked as such. The TPR should identify such
    issues, attempt to pinpoint the source of all reported regressions, and take
    steps to resolve them (e.g., contact the author/reviewer of the offending
    PR).)
    $(LI $(B Review trivial PRs) - pull requests that need no specialized review
    should be reviewed and merged by the TPR.)
    $(LI $(B Fix trivial issues) - the TPR is free to fix trivial issues and
    submit such fixes as pull requests, but must request review from a competent
    reviewer.)
