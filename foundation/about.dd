$(H3 History)

$(P The D programming language was started by Walter Bright, as a 'better C++'
and has grown slowly, but steadily, for more than 15 years. Recent improvements
to the D development process have accelerated development of the language and
shown the need for a governing organization that overlooks and arranges the
future development of the D programming language.)
