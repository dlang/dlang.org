$(P We are always in search of ways to improve the D programming language
experience for new and existing D users. Whether that means hiring programmers
to carry out contract work, sponsoring bounties on specific tasks, providing
scholarships for students performing D-related research, or anything else that
benefits the D community and ecosystem, we cannot make any of it happen without
funding. We $(LINK2 sponsors.html, welcome contributions) from both
organizations and individuals. Your help is highly appreciated and is what
enables the D Language Foundation to fulfill its mission.)

$(H3 How will my donation be used?)

$(P $(B The General Fund) supports all of the D Language Foundation's regular
operations (DConf expenses, part-time workers, blog post bounties, etc.), and is
sometimes used to seed new initiatives. One of the important ways we make use of
the General Fund is $(LINK2
http://dlang.org/blog/2016/12/05/the-d-language-foundations-scholarship-program,
in awarding scholarships) to highly skilled students. Each $(DOLLAR)5 you donate
contributes to approximately one hour of work by a talented graduate student,
and these hours add quickly toward important projects that further the state of
the art in the D programming language.)

$(P If you want to support us and have no particular project you'd like your
donation to be directed toward, then your money is best aimed at the General
Fund where we'll use it as we need it. You may donate to to the General Fund via
$(HTTPS www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NDMzMzE=, our targeted Flipcause
campaign) or via any of the other donation methods listed further down this page
(the General Fund is the default with these methods when you leave no comments
directing us where to target the donation).)

$(P $(B The Human Resource Fund for D Ecoystem Tasks) is earmarked for contract
work to complete important tasks in the D ecosystem that are too complex for a
simple bounty. For example, it has been used to fund work on Android support in
the LDC D compiler and to port DRuntime to WebASM. We will have more work to
fund in the future, so we welcome $(HTTPS
/www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NTUxOTc=, all donations to this fund)
to support that future work.)

$(P $(B The Task Bounty system) allows any donation to be targeted specifically
toward increasing an existing bounty or seeding a new one. Visit the $(HTTPS
www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NjI2Njg=, Task Bounties page) to see
the list of currently available bounties. Click on any of the cards to increase
the bounty for a specific task. The first card in the list is the "Task Bounty
Catch-All". Clicking this allows you to:

$(UL
    $(LI increase multiple bounties at once: enter the total you'd like to
    donate and leave a note decribing how it is to be dispersed among which
    bounties.)
    $(LI seed a new bounty: enter the amount you'd like to donate and
    leave a comment specifying a Bugzilla issue number; if it is a more complex
    task for which there is no Bugzilla issue number, please idicate it as
    such in your comment and someone will be in touch with you for the details.)
))

$(P You may $(HTTPS dlang.org/blog/2019/08/17/bug-bounties-have-arrived/, read
more about Task Bounties) at the D Blog.)

$(P If you have a specific target or project that you wish to directly support
and you feel it does not fit well into our Task Bounty system, please $(LINK2

$(H3 The D Language Foundation is a non-profit organization)

$(P By the Foundation bylaws, its officers (Walter Bright, Andrei Alexandrescu
and Ali Ã‡ehreli) cannot receive income from the Foundation, which preempts a
variety of conflicts of interest.)

$(P For US taxpayers, contributions to the D Language Foundation are
tax-deductible. The D Language Foundation is a $(HTTPS
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization, 501(c) non-profit public charity)
registered in the state of Washington, USA. You should consult your tax adviser
for rules as they apply to your situation.)

$(P Donations to the D Language Foundation are currently not tax-deductible in
most other countries as they require an organisation to be incorporated in that
country and the D Language Foundation does currently not have the resources to
do so.)

$(P If you have a question about donations, please write to the D Language
Foundation at $(LINK2 mailto:foundation@dlang.org, foundation@dlang.org).)
