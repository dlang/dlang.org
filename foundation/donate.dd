$(P We are always in search of ways to improve the D programming language
experience for new and existing D users. Whether that means hiring programmers
to carry out contract work, sponsoring bounties on specific tasks, providing
scholarships for students performing D-related research, or anything else that
benefits the D community and ecosystem, we cannot make any of it happen without
funding. We $(LINK2 sponsors.html, welcome contributions) from both
organizations and individuals. Your help is highly appreciated and is what
enables the D Language Foundation to fulfill its mission.)

$(H3 How will my donation be used?)

$(P Donations go toward supporting the D Language Foundation's regular, non-sponsored
operations (DConf expenses, part-time workers, blog post bounties, reimbursements, etc.).
One of the important ways we make use of donations is $(LINK2
http://dlang.org/blog/2016/12/05/the-d-language-foundations-scholarship-program,
in awarding scholarships) to highly skilled students. Each $(DOLLAR)5 you donate
contributes to approximately one hour of work by a talented graduate student,
and these hours add quickly toward important projects that further the state of
the art in the D programming language.)

$(H3 How can I donate?)

$(DONATE_ITEM Donate through GitHub Sponsors, github,

    The D Language Foundation is enrolled in the GitHub Sponsors program. One-time donations here will go toward our general expense fund. We aim to use
    monthly donations to hire part-time workers who can help us achieve our vision for the D programming language. You can see our current monthly donation target
    along with multiple one-time and monthly donation tiers $(LINK2 https://github.com/sponsors/dlang, on our GitHub Sponsors page).

$(H3 The D Language Foundation is a non-profit organization)

$(P By the Foundation bylaws, its officers (Walter Bright, Andrei Alexandrescu
and Ali Ã‡ehreli) cannot receive income from the Foundation, which preempts a
variety of conflicts of interest.)

$(P For US taxpayers, contributions to the D Language Foundation are
tax-deductible. The D Language Foundation is a $(HTTPS
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization, 501(c) non-profit public charity)
registered in the state of Washington, USA. You should consult your tax adviser
for rules as they apply to your situation.)

$(P Donations to the D Language Foundation are currently not tax-deductible in
most other countries as they require an organisation to be incorporated in that
country and the D Language Foundation does currently not have the resources to
do so.)

$(P If you have a question about donations, please write to the D Language
Foundation at $(LINK2 mailto:foundation@dlang.org, foundation@dlang.org).)
