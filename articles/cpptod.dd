$(P Every experienced C++ programmer accumulates a series of idioms and techniques
which become second nature. Sometimes, when learning a new language, those
idioms can be so comfortable it's hard to see how to do the equivalent in the
new language. So here's a collection of common C++ techniques, and how to do the
corresponding task in D.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 constructors, Defining constructors))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        Constructors have the same name as the class:

$(CPPCODE
class Foo
{
    Foo(int x);
};
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        Constructors are defined with the `this` keyword:

------
class Foo
{
    this(int x) { }
}
------

        which reflects how they are used in D.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 baseclass, Base class initialization))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        Base constructors are called using the base initializer syntax.

$(CPPCODE
class A { A() {... } };
class B : A
{
    B(int x)
        : A()   // call base constructor
    {
        ...
    }
};)

$(H4 The D Way)

        The base class constructor is called with the `super` syntax:

------
class A { this() { ... } }
class B : A
{
    this(int x)
    {
        ...
        super();    // call base constructor
        ...
    }
}
------

        It's superior to C++ in that the base constructor call can be flexibly placed anywhere in the derived
        constructor. D can also have one constructor call another one:

------
class A
{
    int a;
    int b;
    this() { a = 7; b = foo(); }
    this(int x)
    {
        this();
        a = x;
    }
}
------

        Members can also be initialized to constants before the constructor is ever called, so the above example is
        equivalently written as:

------
class A
{
    int a = 7;
    int b;
    this() { b = foo(); }
    this(int x)
    {
        this();
        a = x;
    }
}
------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 structcmp, Comparing structs))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        While C++ defines struct assignment in a simple, convenient manner:

$(CPPCODE
struct A x, y;
...
x = y;
)

        it does not for struct comparisons. Hence, to compare two struct
        instances for equality:

$(CPPCODE
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct A x, y;

inline bool operator==(const A&amp; x, const A&amp; y)
{
    return (memcmp(&amp;x, &amp;y, sizeof(struct A)) == 0);
}
...
if (x == y)
    ...
)

        $(P Note that the operator overload must be done for every struct
        needing to be compared, and the implementation of that overloaded
        operator is free of any language help with type checking.
        The C++ way has an additional problem in that just inspecting the
        (x == y) does not give a clue what is actually happening, you have
        to go and find the particular overloaded operator==() that applies
        to verify what it really does.)

        $(P There's a nasty bug lurking in the memcmp() implementation of operator==().
        The layout of a struct, due to alignment, can have $(SINGLEQUOTE holes) in it.
        C++ does not guarantee those holes are assigned any values, and so
        two different struct instances can have the same value for each member,
        but compare different because the holes contain different garbage.)

        $(P To address this, the operator==() can be implemented to do a memberwise
        compare. Unfortunately, this is unreliable because (1) if a member is added
        to the struct definition one may forget to add it to operator==(), and
        (2) floating point nan values compare unequal even if their bit patterns
        match.)

        There just is no robust solution in C++.

$(H4 The D Way)

        D does it the obvious, straightforward way:

------
A x, y;
...
if (x == y)
    ...

$(H2 $(LNAME2 typedefs, Creating a new typedef'd type))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        Typedefs in C++ are weak, that is, they really do not introduce
        a new type. The compiler doesn't distinguish between a typedef
        and its underlying type.

$(CPPCODE
#define HANDLE_INIT     ((Handle)(-1))
typedef void *Handle;
void foo(void *);
void bar(Handle);

Handle h = HANDLE_INIT;
foo(h);         // coding bug not caught
bar(h);         // ok
)

        The C++ solution is to create a dummy struct whose sole
        purpose is to get type checking and overloading on the new type.

$(CPPCODE
#define HANDLE_INIT     ((void *)(-1))
struct Handle
{
    void *ptr;

    // default initializer
    Handle() { ptr = HANDLE_INIT; }

    Handle(int i) { ptr = (void *)i; }

    // conversion to underlying type
    operator void*() { return ptr; }
};
void bar(Handle);

Handle h;
bar(h);
h = func();
if (h != HANDLE_INIT)
    ...
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        No need for idiomatic constructions like the above.
        You can use $(REF Typedef, std,typecons):

------
alias Handle = Typedef!(void*, cast(void*)-1);
void bar(Handle);

Handle h;
bar(h);
h = func();
if (h != Handle.init)
    ...
------

        Unlike a bare $(D alias), using $(REF Typedef, std,typecons)
        ensures the two types are not considered as equals. Note how a
        default initializer can be supplied to $(REF Typedef, std,typecons)
        as a value of the underlying type.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 friends, Friends))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        Sometimes two classes are tightly related but not by inheritance,
        but need to access each other's private members. This is done
        using $(D friend) declarations:

$(CPPCODE
class A
{
  private:
    int a;

  public:
    int foo(B *j);
    friend class B;
    friend int abc(A *);
};

class B
{
  private:
    int b;

  public:
    int bar(A *j);
    friend class A;
};

int A::foo(B *j) { return j->b; }
int B::bar(A *j) { return j->a; }

int abc(A *p) { return p->a; }
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        In D, friend access is implicit in being a member of the same
        module. It makes sense that tightly related classes should be
        in the same module, so implicitly granting friend access to
        other module members solves the problem neatly:

------
module X;

class A
{
  private:
    static int a;

  public:
    int foo(B j) { return j.b; }
}

class B
{
  private:
    static int b;

  public:
    int bar(A j) { return j.a; }
}

int abc(A p) { return p.a; }
------

        The $(D private) attribute prevents other modules from
        accessing the members.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 operatoroverloading, Operator overloading))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        Given a struct that creates a new arithmetic data type,
        it's convenient to overload the comparison operators so
        it can be compared against integers:

$(CPPCODE
struct A
{
    int operator &lt;  (int i);
    int operator &lt;= (int i);
    int operator &gt;  (int i);
    int operator &gt;= (int i);
};

int operator &lt;  (int i, A &amp;a) { return a &gt;  i; }
int operator &lt;= (int i, A &amp;a) { return a &gt;= i; }
int operator &gt;  (int i, A &amp;a) { return a &lt;  i; }
int operator &gt;= (int i, A &amp;a) { return a &lt;= i; }
)

        A total of 8 functions are necessary.

$(H4 The D Way)

        D recognizes that the comparison operators are all fundamentally
        related to each other. So only one function is necessary:

------
struct A
{
    int opCmp(int i);
}
------

        $(P The compiler automatically interprets all the
        &lt;, &lt;=, &gt; and &gt;=
        operators in terms of the $(D cmp) function, as well
        as handling the cases where the left operand is not an
        object reference.)

        $(P Similar sensible rules hold for other operator overloads,
        making using operator overloading in D much less tedious and less
        error prone. Far less code needs to be written to accomplish
        the same effect.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 usingdeclaration, Namespace using declarations))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        A $(I using-declaration) in C++ is used to bring a name from
        a namespace scope into the current scope:

$(CPPCODE
namespace foo
{
    int x;
}
using foo::x;
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        D uses modules instead of namespaces and #include files, and
        alias declarations take the place of using declarations:

------
/** Module foo.d **/
module foo;
int x;

/** Another module **/
import foo;
alias x = foo.x;
------

        Alias is a much more flexible than the single purpose using
        declaration. Alias can be used to rename symbols, refer to
        template members, refer to nested class types, etc.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 raii, RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        In C++, resources like memory, etc., all need to be handled
        explicitly. Since destructors automatically get called when
        leaving a scope, RAII is implemented by putting the resource
        release code into the destructor:

$(CPPCODE
class File
{
    Handle *h;

    ~File()
    {
        h->release();
    }
};
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        $(P The bulk of resource release problems are simply keeping track
        of and freeing memory. This is handled automatically in D by
        the garbage collector. The second common resources used are semaphores
        and locks, handled automatically with D's $(D synchronized)
        declarations and statements.)

        $(P The few RAII issues left are handled by $(D struct)s.
        A $(D struct) gets its destructor run when it goes out of scope.)

------
struct File
{
    Handle h;

    ~this()
    {
        h.release();
    }
}

void test()
{
    if (...)
    {
        auto f = File();
        ...
    } // f.~this() gets run at closing brace, even if
      // scope was exited via a thrown exception
}
------

$(P $(D class)es are typically managed by the garbage collector which doesn't
lend itself to RAII. If you need deterministic destruction with $(D class)es
you can use $(REF scoped, std,typecons) (which will also allocate the
$(D class) on the stack instead of the garbage collector managed heap).)

$(P See also $(GLINK2 statement, ScopeGuardStatement) for a more generalized
mechanism that lets you run arbitrary statements whenever leaving the current
scope.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 properties, Properties))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        It is common practice to define a field,
        along with object-oriented
        get and set functions for it:

$(CPPCODE
class Abc
{
  public:
    void setProperty(int newproperty) { property = newproperty; }
    int getProperty() { return property; }

  private:
    int property;
};

Abc a;
a.setProperty(3);
int x = a.getProperty();
)

        All this is quite a bit of typing, and it tends to make
        code unreadable by filling
        it with getProperty() and setProperty() calls.

$(H4 The D Way)

        Properties can be get and set using the normal field syntax,
        yet the get and set will invoke methods instead.

------
class Abc
{
    // set
    @property void property(int newproperty) { myprop = newproperty; }

    // get
    @property int property() { return myprop; }

  private:
    int myprop;
}
------

        which is used as:

------
Abc a = new Abc;
a.property = 3;
int x = a.property;
------

        Thus, in D a property is treated like it was a simple field name.
        A property can start out actually being a simple field name,
        but if later it becomes
        necessary to make getting and setting it function calls,
        no code needs to be modified other
        than the class definition.
        It obviates the wordy practice of defining get and set properties
        $(SINGLEQUOTE just in case) a derived class should need to override them.
        It's also a way to have interface classes, which do not have
        data fields, behave syntactically as if they did.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 recursivetemplates, Recursive Templates))

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        An advanced use of templates is to recursively expand
        them, relying on specialization to end it. A template
        to compute a factorial would be:

$(CPPCODE
template&lt;int n&gt; class factorial
{
  public:
    enum { result = n * factorial&lt;n - 1&gt;::result };
};

template&lt;&gt; class factorial&lt;1&gt;
{
  public:
    enum { result = 1 };
};

void test()
{
    printf("%d\n", factorial&lt;4&gt;::result); // prints 24
}
)

$(H4 The D Way)

        The D version is analogous, though a little simpler, taking
        advantage of
        $(HTTPS dlang.org/spec/template.html#implicit_template_properties,
        Eponymous Templates) - promotion of single template members to the
        enclosing name space:
------
template factorial(int n)
{
    enum factorial = n * .factorial!(n-1);
}

template factorial(int n : 1)
{
    enum factorial = 1;
}

void test()
{
    writeln(factorial!(4));  // prints 24
}
------
        The template blocks can be made shorter using
        $(HTTPS dlang.org/spec/template.html#variable-template,
        Enum Template) syntax:
------
enum factorial(int n) = n * .factorial!(n-1);

enum factorial(int n : 1) = 1;

$(H2 $(LNAME2 metatemplates, Meta Templates))

        The problem: create a typedef for a signed integral type that is at
        least $(I nbits) in size.

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        $(P This example is simplified and adapted from one written by
        Dr. Carlo Pescio in
        <a href="http://www.eptacom.net/pubblicazioni/pub_eng/paramint.html">
        Template Metaprogramming: Make parameterized integers portable with this novel technique</a>.)

        $(P There is no way in C++ to do conditional compilation based
        on the result of an expression based on template parameters, so
        all control flow follows from pattern matching of the template
        argument against various explicit template specializations.
        Even worse, there is no way to do template specializations based
        on relationships like "less than or equal to", so the example
        uses a clever technique where the template is recursively expanded,
        incrementing the template value argument by one each time, until
        a specialization matches.
        If there is no match, the result is an unhelpful recursive compiler
        stack overflow or internal error, or at best a strange syntax
        error.)

        A preprocessor macro is also needed to make up for the lack
        of template typedefs.

$(CPPCODE
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;

template&lt; int nbits &gt; struct Integer
{
    typedef Integer&lt; nbits + 1 &gt; :: int_type int_type ;
};

};

struct Integer&lt; 32 &gt;
{
    typedef long int_type ;
};

struct Integer&lt; 64 &gt;
{
    typedef long long int_type ;
};

// If the required size is not supported, the metaprogram
// will increase the counter until an internal error is
// signaled, or INT_MAX is reached. The INT_MAX
// specialization does not define a int_type, so a
// compiling error is always generated
struct Integer&lt; INT_MAX &gt;
{
};

// A bit of syntactic sugar
#define Integer( nbits ) Integer&lt; nbits &gt; :: int_type

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    printf("%d %d %d %d\n",
        sizeof(i), sizeof(j), sizeof(k), sizeof(l));
    return 0 ;
}
)

$(H4 The C++ Boost Way)

        This version uses the C++ Boost library. It was provided
        by David Abrahams.

$(CPPCODE

        Unlike the C++ example, this one is fairly easy to

        It compiles quickly, and gives a sensible compile time message
        if it fails.

$(H4 The C++ Way)

        The following template comes from

        C++ Templates: The Complete Guide, David Vandevoorde, Nicolai M. Josuttis</a>
        pg. 353 which determines if the template's argument type

$(CPPCODE

};

void test()
{
    typedef int (fp)(int);

    assert(IsFunctionT&lt;fp&gt;::Yes == 1);
}

        This template relies on the $(SFINAE) principle.
        Why it works is a fairly advanced template topic.

$(H4 The D Way)

        $(ACRONYM SFINAE, Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
        can be done in D without resorting to template argument
        pattern matching:

template IsFunctionT(T)
{
    static if ( is(T[]) )
        const int IsFunctionT = 0;

}

void test()
{
    alias int fp(int);

    assert(IsFunctionT!(fp) == 1);
}
------

        The task of discovering if a type is a function doesn't need a
        template at all, nor does it need the subterfuge of attempting to
        create the invalid array of functions type.
        The $(ISEXPRESSION) expression can test it directly:

$(H2 $(LNAME2 interfaces, Interfaces))


Interfaces in C++ are used to describe the behaviour or capabilities of any class
that implements the interface, without committing to a particular implementation
of the interface's declared methods.

$(H4 Interfaces in C++)

        "C++ interfaces are implemented by means of $(I abstract classes). An abstract class

        mainly unimplemented method declarations (non-static method definitions and non-static data
        members are not allowed). The implementation class inherits one or more interfaces and

        D doesn't have a (C++-style) concept of references as part of the type. Arguments can be passed by reference - hence the `ref` keyword, but "free" references don't exist in the language.

        The `ref` in `foreach` loop variables can be conceptually thought of as a parameter to the loop body as well. (For `opApply` based iteration, the loop body indeed gets turned into a function; for "plain" iteration the compiler AST internally has special `ref` variables, but they are not visible to the language.)

        In the below code, `d2` is a value copy of `gallery[0]` and is not a reference.

$(RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE
------
module test;

void main()
{
    struct Data
    {
        int id;
    }

    import std.container.array : Array;
    Array!Data gallery;

    Data d1;
    gallery.insertBack(d1);

    auto d2 = gallery[0];
    d2.id = 1;
    assert(d2.id != gallery[0].id); // d2 is neither ref nor pointer
}
------
)

        Instead of trying to get a reference in such a case, get a pointer. After all, you don't have to use `->` operator in D, which is nice in syntax.

    auto d2 = &gallery[0];
