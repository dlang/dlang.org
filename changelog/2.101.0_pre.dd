$(P
`extern(C)` isn't a requirement for CRT con/destructors anymore when
using the default `void ()` signature.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.d_optimized,Add predefined version `D_Optimized` when compiling with `-O`)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.d_optimized.dd)
$(P
It allows code to distinguish whether it's being compiled with optimizations enabled (the `-O` flag was provided).
This is orthogonal to whether `-release` mode is active - for that see the
predefined versions `assert`, `D_NoBoundsChecks`, `D_Invariants`, etc.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.deprecate_throwing_nothrow_contracts,Throwing from contracts of `nothrow` functions has been deprecated)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.deprecate_throwing_nothrow_contracts.dd)
$(P
Up until now, the compiler accepted `in` and `out` contracts of `nothrow`
functions to throw exceptions and call throwing functions. As this breaks
`nothrow` guarantees, a deprecation notice is now triggered.

$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.deprecate_version_int.dd)
$(P
The problem is that it only provides a single number namespace without any meaning.
It's better to use version identifiers describing the feature they enable.

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.dip1000_deprecation_warnings,Print deprecations for `scope` pointer errors)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.dip1000_deprecation_warnings.dd)
$(P
The `scope` attribute has existed for a long time, but the compiler would only verify its semantics when the `-preview=dip1000` switch was passed, to avoid breaking code.
Pointers or references stored in a scope variable are not allowed to escape the scope in which the variable is defined.
)

$(P
Usually, it is not necessary to mark variables `scope`, since the [Garbage Collector](https://dlang.org/spec/garbage.html) (GC) takes care of freeing memory.
However, D allows creating pointers / slices that point to local variables, which use [Stack-based memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation) and are destructed at the end of their scope.
It is important that in `@safe` code, creating such pointers is either disallowed, or has `scope` semantics enforced, but the compiler would formerly fail to do that:
)

---
@safe:
int[] getSlice()
{
    int[4] stackBuffer;
    int[] slice = stackBuffer[]; // slice points to local variable allocated on stack
    return slice; // dangling pointer!
}

struct S
{
    int x;

    int* get()
    {
        int* y = &this.x; // this struct instance could be a local variable
        return y; // dangerous!
    }
}
---

$(P
Starting with this release, `scope` semantics are enforced in `@safe` code on pointers to stack memory, but only as deprecation warnings.
Eventually, they will be turned into errors.
To turn them into errors immediately, use `-preview=dip1000`.
To disable the deprecations, use `-revert=dip1000`.
)

$(P

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.dtoh-improvements,Improvements for the C++ header generation)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.dtoh-improvements.dd)
$(P
The following features/bugfixes/improvements were implemented for the
experimental C++ header generator:
)

$(P
- Overriding virtual functions are now marked with the `override` keyword when
  generating C++11 compatible headers.
- Final virtual functions are now marked with the `final` keyword when
  generating C++11 compatible headers.
)

$(P
Note: The header generator is still considered experimental, so please submit
      any bugs encountered to [the bug tracker](https://issues.dlang.org).
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.fix-immutable-conv,`-preview=fixImmmutableConv` has been added)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.fix-immutable-conv.dd)
$(P
The compiler allows implicitly converting a return value with indirections to immutable if it determines the result must be unique.
Formerly, this check would inspect the types of the indirections, and forget to take into account conversions, such as `int[]` to `void[]`:
)

---
int[] f(ref void[] m) pure
{
    auto result = new int[5];
    m = result;
    return result;
}

void main()
{
    void[] v;
    immutable x = f(v);
    // `v` is now a mutable alias to immutable variable `x`
}
---

$(P
This was filed as [issue 15660](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15660), which has been fixed some time ago by making the check more strict: the called function must be strongly pure.
However, to avoid breaking code, the fix was only active with the `-preview=dip1000` switch.
Since it is unrelated to dip1000 (which is about `scope` pointers), the fix has been moved to a new `-preview=fixImmmutableConv` switch.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.fix22134,Returning a discarded void value from a function is now deprecated)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.fix22134.dd)
$(P
An expression statement of type void that has no side effects should
be discarded since it has no effect. The compiler, generally, does not
allow such statements, however, in the case of return statements this
error is circumvented. For example:
)

---
struct StackBuffer
{
    auto opIndex(size_t i)
    {
        return arr[i];
    }

private:
    void[] arr;
}
---

$(P
Although this code compiles, any call to `opIndex` is going to result in an
error because the return type must either be stored somewhere (and variables
cannot be of type void) or the call will have no effect.
)

$(P
Starting with this release, returning a discarded void value from a function
is deprecated. Such code can be deleted as it most certainly is dead code.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.importc_typeof,ImportC now recognizes the `typeof(...)` operator)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.importc_typeof.dd)
$(P
ISO C does not specify a `typeof` operator, but it is a widely-implemented vendor extension.
ImportC now implements this extension as well.
)

$(P
Only the form `typeof(...)` is recognized, other compilers also support (or only support one of)
`__typeof__(...)` and `__typeof(...)`. Imported C using these forms will need to be normalized with `#define`s.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.markdown,Removed the `-transition=markdown` and `-revert=markdown` switches)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.markdown.dd)
$(P
This release removes the `-transition=markdown`, which prints markdown substitutions
made when processing markdown in ddoc documentation blocks, and `-revert=markdown`
switches which disables markdown substitutions in ddoc documentation blocks.
)

$(P
Markdown substitutions have been the default for some time now, and as of this release
is always performed.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.new-aa,`new` can now allocate an associative array)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.new-aa.dd)
$(P
This allows two associative array references to point to the same
associative array instance before any keys have been inserted.
)

---
int[string] a = new int[string];
auto b = a;
...
a["seven"] = 7;
assert(b["seven"] == 7);
---

$(P
Note: Calling `new` is not needed before inserting keys on a null
associative array reference - the instance will be allocated if it
doesn't exist.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 dmd.previewInLink,`-preview=in` can now be used with `extern(C++)`, disabled for other non-D linkage)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/dmd.previewInLink.dd)
$(P
The intent of `-preview=in` is to make `in` the go-to storage class for input parameters in D.
However, it is D centric, as it is an enhanced version of `scope const ref`.
As non-`extern(D)` functions usually are expected to match a specific ABI,
using `in` is hardly a good idea.
)

$(P
As C++ also has a "go to" storage class for input parameters (`const T&`),
`in` can also be applied on `extern(C++)` function in order to bind to `const T&` parameters.
This also allows to expose a closer API for a function than via `const ref`,
as `in` will allow to bind rvalues to `const T&`, as in C++.
)
)

$(BUGSTITLE_TEXT_BODY Runtime changes,

$(LI $(LNAME2 druntime.cpuid-add-avx512f,Added avx512f detection to `core.cpuid`)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/druntime.cpuid-add-avx512f.dd)
$(P
The feature flag `core.cpuid.avx512f` has been added to allow detection at
run-time CPUs with 512-bit vector support.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 druntime.drt-oncycle-deprecate,`--DRT-oncycle=deprecate` is removed)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/druntime.drt-oncycle-deprecate.dd)
$(P
The option was [introduced in 2.072.2](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.072.2.html#drt-cycle-deprecated) to help transition code that relied on the old faulty cycle checker for module constructors.
It now prints a warning and does the same as the default, `--DRT-oncycle=abort`.
See also: $(DDSUBLINK spec/module, order_of_static_ctor, Order of Static Construction) in the specification.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 druntime.posix_gc_signals,Posix (excl. Darwin): Switch default GC signals from SIGUSR1/2 to SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMIN+1)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dmd, changelog/druntime.posix_gc_signals.dd)
$(P
As the SIGUSR ones might be used by 'system' libraries (e.g., Android
Dalvik VM or LLVM libFuzzer), while the SIGRT ones are reserved for
user-defined purposes and less likely to collide.
)

$(P
The used signals can still be customized with an early call to
`core.thread.osthread.thread_setGCSignals()`.
)
)


)

$(BUGSTITLE_TEXT_BODY Library changes,

$(LI $(LNAME2 borrow_for_refcounted,Added `SafeRefCounted`, that can be used in `@safe` with `-preview=dip1000`.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/borrow_for_refcounted.dd)
$(P
`RefCounted` is only available for `@system` code, because of the possibility of
escaping a reference to its payload past the end of its lifetime. a modified
copy of it, `std.typecons.SafeRefCounted` has been added. Also added is a
`borrow` function, that lets one safely access and modify the payload.
`-preview=dip1000` prevents escaping a reference to it in `@safe` code.
)

-------
@safe pure nothrow void fun()
{
    import std.typecons;

    auto rcInt = safeRefCounted(5);
    assert(rcInt.borrow!(theInt => theInt) == 5);
    auto sameInt = rcInt;
    assert(sameInt.borrow!"a" == 5);

    // using `ref` in the function
    auto arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    sameInt.borrow!(ref (x) => arr[x]) = 10;
    assert(arr == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 6]);

    // modifying the payload via an alias
    sameInt.borrow!"a*=2";
    assert(rcInt.borrow!"a" == 10);
}
-------

$(P
Direct access to the payload unfortunately has to be `@system`, though. While
`-dip1000` could prevent escaping the reference, it is possible to destroy the
last reference before the end of it's scope:
)

-------
int destroyFirstAndUseLater()
{
    import std.typecons;

    auto rc = SafeRefCounted!int(123);
    int* ptr = &rc.refCountedPayload();
    destroy(rc);
    return *ptr; // Reads from freed memory. Don't do this.
}
-------

$(P
As a side effect, this enabled us to make $(REF dirEntries, std, file) `@safe`
with `-preview=dip1000`.
)

$(P
Some member functions of `RefCounted` that are `@safe` are not so in
`SafeRefCounted`. The `RefCounted` type and `refCounted` function are still
available for the old behaviour. However, their main purpose is backwards
compatibility. They are not recommended for new code.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 logger,Move logger out of experimental.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/logger.dd)
$(P
The std.experimental.logger package is now std.logger. The old package and modules are
still available and publicly import the new ones. To avoid breakage in modules that compile
with deprecations as errors, for now the old modules aren't deprecated, but they will be.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 logger_remove_compile_time_loglevel,remove std.experimental.logger's capability to set the minimal LogLevel at compile time)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/logger_remove_compile_time_loglevel.dd)
$(P
Before this change std.experimental.logger had the capability to disable
logging at compile time.
It was also possible to set the minimal LogLevel at compile time.
The trade-off between gained capability, added complexity, and error-proneness
was too heavily tilted towards the second two items.
This change removes these compile time features.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 logger_sharedLog_returning_shared_logger,Change std.experimental.logger.core.sharedLog to return shared(Logger))
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/logger_sharedLog_returning_shared_logger.dd)
$(P
To make unsafe code more explicit std.experimental.logger.sharedLog
now returns a shared(Logger) instead of a Logger.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 remove-experimental-typecons,std.experimental.typecons has been removed)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/remove-experimental-typecons.dd)
$(P
This was an attempt to update `std.typecons.wrap` with an implementation that could work with struct, but it did not go anywhere.
See [this post on the forum](https://forum.dlang.org/post/ialskabybaxtqamgtwge@forum.dlang.org).
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 remove-std-digest-digest,std.digest.digest has been removed)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/remove-std-digest-digest.dd)
$(P
This module was initially deprecated in 2.076.1, and has been empty since
2.092.0 when all deprecated symbols were removed in favour of importing
`std.digest` or its submodules instead.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 remove-std-xml,std.xml has been removed)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/remove-std-xml.dd)
$(P
This module is considered out-dated and not up to Phobos' current standards.
If you still need it, go to $(LINK https://github.com/DigitalMars/undeaD)
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 scopesocket,`std.socket.Socket` methods now accept only `scope` arrays.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/scopesocket.dd)
$(P
To comply with dip1000, `std.socket.Socket` methods now all have `scope`
attributes applied to any slice parameters. This includes `receive` and `send`
flavors, and also `setOption`. While not technically a breaking change for
users of `Socket`, if you derive from it, you must apply those attributes to your
derivatives or it will fail to compile. However, applying the attributes is
backwards compatible with previous versions of Phobos, so there is no need for
a migration path.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 std_outbuffer_align,Add custom fill value to std.outbuffer.OutBuffer class)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE phobos, changelog/std_outbuffer_align.dd)
$(P
Extend the fill, alignSize, align{2,4} methods of `std.outbuffer.OutBuffer` to specify value to write
when filling (up to an alignment).
)

$(P
For flash device images it is desirable to use 0xff as the fill value,
because 0xff is the value of the unprogrammed flash memory cell. Padding
with 0 requires to programm the flash cell from 0xff to 0x00, which
increases wear and tear on the flash memory device. Usually there is some
larger block at the end if the flash memory image, which must be padded
up to the size of the flash device (usually a power of two). Instead
of padding with 0x00 the PR allows to fill with 0xff instead.
)

$(P
There might be also some other use-cases, where it might be reasonable to fill
the alignment gaps with some other value than 0x00, e.g. when debugging
and viewing output data in a hex editor. It is easier to spot gaps, when
the padded spaces contain a custom value like 0x55 or 0xaa.
)

$(P
A new fill method was added, which allows filling with a user-defined value
instead of the 0 as in the previous implementation.
)

-------
OutBuffer buf = new OutBuffer();
buff.fill( 1234, 42 ); // Fills 1234 bytes with 42 starting at buf.offset
buff.fill( 10 );       // Same as fill0( 10 );
-------

$(P
The alignSize, align{2,4} methods were modified to use some user-defined
value for padding to the requested alignment boundary.
)

-------
OutBuffer buf = new OutBuffer();
buf.write(cast(ubyte) 1);
buf.align2(0x55);
assert(buf.toBytes() == "\x01\x55");
buf.write(cast(ubyte) 2);
buf.align4(0x55);
assert(buf.toBytes() == "\x01\x55\x02\x55");
buf.write(cast(ubyte) 3);
buf.alignSize(8, 0x55);
assert(buf.toBytes() == "\x01\x55\x02\x55\x03\x55\x55\x55");

$(BUGSTITLE_TEXT_BODY Dub changes,

$(LI $(LNAME2 build_unittest,Building the special test runner configuration)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/build_unittest.dd)
$(P
`dub build --config=unittest --build=unittest[-cov]` can now be used to
mimic building the test runner executable of `dub test [--coverage]`.
Note that this doesn't require an existing `unittest` configuration.
)

$(P
`dub describe --config=unittest` allows to derive the path to the
executable.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 colored_output,Output will now be colorized)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/colored_output.dd)
$(P
Dub output has been improved to be more human readable,
which means the most important informations in the output
will now be colorized / bold.
)

$(P
As is usual with CLI tools, this behavior is automatically
turned on whether the output is a TTY. To force the old output
in the presence of a TTY, use `--color=off`. To force colored
output in the absence of a TTY, use `--color=on`.
)

$(P
The `--color` flag, if set to `on` or `off`, is automatically
forwarded to the compiler. This is especially useful for CI
pipelines to ensure human-readable output.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 configy_stricter_parsing,dub will now warn on unrecognized settings or selections file)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/configy_stricter_parsing.dd)
$(P
Previously, dub was silently accepting anything it didn't recognize
in `[dub.]settings.json` and `dub.selections.json`. While the original
intent was to make forward-compatibility easy, it proved detrimental
as typos would just mean the user setting was ignored.
)

$(P
From this release, dub will now warn about any entry in its configuration files
or in `dub.selections.json`. After 10 releases, those warnings will turn into errors.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 cov_ctfe,The two new build types `cov-ctfe` and `unittest-cov-ctfe` have been added.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/cov_ctfe.dd)

These extend the existing build types `cov` and `unittest-cov` respectively by
appending `-cov=ctfe` to the set of flags passed to the compiler.

You can now configure where DUB places its downloaded packages and where the user configuration is stored through environment variables or through the dub configuration. You need to use an environment variable or the system-wide dub configuration to specify where the user configuration is stored.
)

$(P
By default DUB stores the packages on
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/dub/settings.json` + `%LOCALAPPDATA%/dub/packages/`
- Posix: `$HOME/.dub/{packages/,settings.json}`
)

$(P
now if the `DUB_HOME` environment variable is set it instead stores the packages (and other config) in
- `$DUB_HOME/{packages/,settings.json}`
)

$(P
alternatively if `DUB_HOME` isn't set, but `DPATH` is set, the following path is used:
- `$DPATH/dub/{packages/,settings.json}`
)

$(P
The `DPATH` environment variable is intended to be used by all D tooling related things doing user-space installation of things. It can be used to avoid cluttering the home folder.
)

$(P
Additionally to environment variables it is possible to configure the package placement path + settings.json path through DUB's settings.json file. To configure where the user-editable settings.json is placed you need to adjust the system-wide dub configuration.
)

$(P
In the settings.json you can set the following fields:
)

```json
{
    "dubHome": "/path/to/dub", // sets both package store and config location
}
```

$(P
Additionally, these config paths will have environment variables using the `$VARIABLE` syntax resolved.
)

$(P
The following list describes which path is going to be picked, from top to bottom, stopping whenever one is found:
)

$(P
- `$DUB_HOME` environment variable
- `$DPATH` environment variable
- system-wide settings.json: `"dubHome"` property (only for userSettings)
- most specific settings.json: `"dubHome"` property (only for localRepository)
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 exitcodes,DUB command exit codes have been made more consistent)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/exitcodes.dd)
$(P
Some dub commands have been adjusted to return exit code 2 instead of exit code 1. Exit code 1 is now always used for usage errors, while exit code 2 is the more generic any error occurred or package failed to load.
)

$(P
The following commands are affected:
)

$(P
- dub clean
- dub add
- dub search
- dub convert
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 install_uninstall,'install' and 'uninstall' commands have been removed)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/install_uninstall.dd)
$(P
Those commands were long-deprecated aliases to `fetch` and `remove`,
respectively, and usage of them triggered a warning.
They are no longer listed as command in help and dub will no longer recognize them.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 make-copies-writable,When `copyFiles` is used to copy read-only files, it now makes the copy writable.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/make-copies-writable.dd)
$(P
Previously, if the target file would already exist due to a prior run of Dub, `copyFiles` would produce an access
denied error because the read-only target could not be overwritten. Note that if you were affected by this behaviour,
you will need to remove those files by hand once to eliminate these errors.
)

$(P
It is common for version control systems to mark binary files read-only in the working copy, to prevent concurrent
edits of files in unmergeable formats.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 overrides_deprecated,The override system is deprecated)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/overrides_deprecated.dd)
$(P
Dub had an "override" system, allowing a specific version or version range
to be overriden by a specific package.
This override system was developed with a purely version-based approach in mind,
however since its inception, more ways to specify dependencies have been added,
making the override approach redundant and less flexible than other approaches.
From this release, dub will warn you if it finds an override file,
or when using the `dub add-override` / `dub remove-override` commands.
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 subpackage_short_syntax,The shortcut syntax for "dub run" is now also available for sub packages.)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/subpackage_short_syntax.dd)
$(P
Invoking dub as "dub :subpackage" is now equivalent to "dub run :subpackage",
analogous to just "dub" being equivalent to "dub run".
)
)

$(LI $(LNAME2 subpackage_upgrade,Upgrading all sub packages at once)
$(CHANGELOG_SOURCE_FILE dub, changelog/subpackage_upgrade.dd)
$(P
A new "-s" switch allows to "dub upgrade" all sub packages together with the
base package. This aims to provide a better workflow for fully reproducible
builds and tests.
