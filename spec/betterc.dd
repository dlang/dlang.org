`-betterC` is a command-line flag for `dmd`,
which restricts the compiler's support of certain runtime features.
Notably, D programs or libraries compiled with `betterC` aren't linked with Druntime.
The use of compile-time features is not restricted in any way.

Limiting a program or library to this subset of runtime features is useful
when targeting constrained environments where the use of such features is not practical or possible.
Additionally, this also makes embedding D libraries in larger projects easier by:

$(OL
    $(LI Simplifying the process of integration at the build-system level)
    $(LI Removing the need to ensure that Druntime is properly initialized on calls to the library, when an initialization step is not performed before the library is used.)
    $(LI Mixing memory management strategies (GC + manual memory management) can sometimes be tricky, hence removing D's GC from the equation may be a good solution)
)

extern(C) void main()
{
    import core.stdc.stdio : printf;
    printf("Hello betterC\n");
}

$(CONSOLE
> dmd -betterC hello.d && ./hello
Hello betterC
)

As no Druntime is available, many D features won't work.
For example:

$(OL
    $(LI Garbage Collection)
    $(LI Thread-local storage)
    $(LI TypeInfo and ModuleInfo)
    $(LI Classes)
    $(LI Built-in threading (e.g. $(MREF core, thread)))
    $(LI Dynamic arrays (but not slices) and associative arrays)
    $(LI Exceptions)
    $(LI `switch` with strings)
    $(LI `final switch`)
    $(LI `synchronized` and $(MREF core, sync))
    $(LI Static module constructors or deconstructors)
    $(LI Struct deconstructors)
    $(LI `unittest` (testing can be as usual with the `-betterC` flag))
)

The predefined $(LINK2 version.html, version) `D_BetterC` can be used for conditional compilation.
