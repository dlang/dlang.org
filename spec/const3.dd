$(HEADERNAV_TOC)

        $(P Type qualifiers modify a type by applying a $(GLINK2 type, TypeCtor).
        $(I TypeCtor)s are: $(D const), $(D immutable), $(D shared), and $(D inout).
        Each applies transitively to all subtypes.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 const_and_immutable, Const and Immutable))

        $(P When examining a data structure or interface, it is very
        helpful to be able to easily tell which data can be expected to not
        change, which data might change, and who may change that data.
        This is done with the aid of the language typing system.
        Data can be marked as const or immutable, with the default being
        changeable (or $(I mutable)).
        )

        $(P $(D immutable) applies to data that cannot change.
        Immutable data values, once constructed, remain the same for
        the duration of the program's
        execution.
        Immutable data can be placed in ROM (Read Only Memory) or in
        memory pages marked by the hardware as read only.
        Since immutable data does not change, it enables many opportunities
        for program optimization, and has applications in functional
        style programming.
        )

        $(P $(D const) applies to data that cannot be changed by
        the const reference to that data. It may, however, be changed
        by another reference to that same data.
        Const finds applications in passing data through interfaces
        that promise not to modify them.
        )

        $(P Both immutable and const are $(I transitive), which means
        that any data reachable through an immutable reference is also
        immutable, and likewise for const.
        )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 immutable_storage_class, Immutable Storage Class))

        $(P
        The simplest immutable declarations use it as a storage class.
        It can be used to declare manifest constants.

---
immutable int x = 3;  // x is set to 3
x = 4;        // error, x is immutable
char[x] s;    // s is an array of 3 chars
---

        $(P The type can be inferred from the initializer:
        )
---
immutable y = 4; // y is of type int
y = 5;           // error, y is immutable
---

        $(P If the initializer is not present, the immutable can
        be initialized from the corresponding constructor:
        )

---
immutable int z;
void test()
{
    z = 3; // error, z is immutable
}
static this()
{
    z = 3; // ok, can set immutable that doesn't
           // have static initializer
}
---
        $(P
        The initializer for a non-local immutable declaration must be
        evaluatable
        at compile time:
        )

---
int foo(int f) { return f * 3; }
int i = 5;
immutable x = 3 * 4;      // ok, 12
immutable y = i + 1;      // error, cannot evaluate at compile time
immutable z = foo(2) + 1; // ok, foo(2) can be evaluated at compile time, 7
---

        $(P The initializer for a non-static local immutable declaration
        is evaluated at run time:
        )
---
int foo(int f)
{
    immutable x = f + 1;  // evaluated at run time
    x = 3;                // error, x is immutable
}
---

        $(P
        Because immutable is transitive, data referred to by an immutable is
        also immutable:
        )

---
immutable char[] s = "foo";
s[0] = 'a';  // error, s refers to immutable data
s = "bar";   // error, s is immutable
---

        $(P Immutable declarations can appear as lvalues, i.e. they can
        have their address taken, and occupy storage.

        Data that will never change its value can be typed as immutable.

---
immutable(char)[] s = "hello";
---

        $(P
        The immutable applies to the type within the following parentheses.
        So, while $(CODE s) can be assigned new values,

s[0] = 'b';  // error, s[] is immutable
s = null;    // ok, s itself is not immutable

        $(P
        Immutability is transitive, meaning it applies to anything that
        can be referenced from the immutable type:
        )

---
immutable(char*)** p = ...;
p = ...;        // ok, p is not immutable
*p = ...;       // ok, *p is not immutable
**p = ...;      // error, **p is immutable
***p = ...;     // error, ***p is immutable
---

        $(P Immutable used as a storage class is equivalent to using
        immutable as a type qualifier for the entire type of a
        declaration:)

---
immutable int x = 3;   // x is typed as immutable(int)
immutable(int) y = 3;  // y is immutable

$(H2 $(LNAME2 creating_immutable_data, Creating Immutable Data))

                    // to mutable
---

        $(P
        The second way is to cast data to immutable.
        When doing so, it is up to the programmer to ensure that any mutable
        references to the same data are not used to modify the data after the
        cast.

        $(P
        The $(CODE .idup) property is a convenient way to create an immutable

$(H2 $(LNAME2 removing_with_cast, Removing Immutable or Const with a Cast))

immutable int* p = ...;
int* q = cast(int*)p;

        $(P
        This does not mean, however, that one can change the data:
        )

---
*q = 3; // allowed by compiler, but result is undefined behavior
---

        $(P
        The ability to cast away immutable-correctness is necessary in
        some cases where the static typing is incorrect and not fixable, such
        as when referencing code in a library one cannot change.
        Casting is, as always, a blunt and effective instrument, and
        when using it to cast away immutable-correctness, one must assume
        the responsibility to ensure the immutability of the data, as
        the compiler will no longer be able to statically do so.

order.)

$(P Applying a qualifier to a type that already has that qualifier is legal but
has no effect, e.g. given an unqualified type `T`, $(D shared(const shared T))

$(P Applying the `immutable` qualifier to any type (qualified or not) results in
$(D immutable T). Applying any qualifier to $(D immutable T) results in
`immutable T`. This makes `immutable` a fixed point of qualifier combinations and
makes types such as $(D const(immutable(shared T))) impossible to create.)

$(P Assuming `T` is an unqualified type, the graph below illustrates how
qualifiers combine (combinations with `immutable` are omitted). For each node,
applying the qualifier labeling the edge leads to the resulting type.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 implicit_qualifier_conversions, Implicit Qualifier Conversions))

$(P Values that have no mutable indirections (including structs that don't
contain any field with mutable indirections) can be implicitly converted across
$(I mutable), $(D const), $(D immutable), $(D const shared), $(D inout) and
$(D inout shared).)

$(P References to qualified objects can be implicitly converted according to the
following rules:)

$(P In the graph above, any directed path is a legal implicit conversion. No
other qualifier combinations than the ones shown is valid. If a directed path
exists between two sets of qualifiers, the types thus qualified are called
$(GLOSSARY qualifier-convertible). The same information is shown below in tabular
format:)

$(H3 $(LNAME2 unique-expressions, Unique Expressions))

        $(P If an implicit conversion is disallowed by the table, an $(GLINK2 expression, Expression)
        may be implicitly converted as follows:
        )
        $(UL
        $(LI From mutable or shared to immutable if the expression
        is unique and all expressions it transitively refers to are either unique or immutable.
        )
        $(LI From mutable to shared if the expression
        is unique and all expressions it transitively refers to are either unique, immutable,
        or shared.
        )
        $(LI From immutable to mutable if the expression is unique.
        )
        $(LI From shared to mutable if the expression is unique.
        )
        )

        $(P A $(I Unique Expression) is one for which there are no other references to the
        value of the expression and all expressions it transitively refers to are either
        also unique or are immutable. For example:)

$(SPEC_RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE_COMPILE
---
void main()
{
    immutable int** p = new int*(null); // ok, unique

    int x;
    //immutable int** q = new int*(&x); // error, there may be other references to x

    immutable int y;
    immutable int** r = new immutable(int)*(&y); // ok, y is immutable
}
---
)
        $(P See also: $(DDSUBLINK spec/function, pure-factory-functions, Pure Factory Functions).)

        $(P Otherwise, a $(GLINK2 expression, CastExpression) can be used to force a conversion
        when an implicit version is disallowed, but this cannot be done in $(D @safe) code,
        and the correctness of it must be verified by the user.
