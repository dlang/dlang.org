$(SPEC_S Introduction,

$(P D is a general-purpose systems programming language with a C-like syntax that compiles to native code.
It is statically typed and supports both automatic $(LPAREN)garbage collected$(RPAREN) and manual memory management.
D programs are structured as modules that can be compiled separately and linked with external libraries
to create native libraries or executables.)

$(P This document is the reference manual for the D Programming Language. For more information and
other documents$(COMMA) see $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/, The D Language Website).)

$(H2 Phases of Compilation)

$(P The process of compiling is divided into multiple phases. Each phase is
independent of subsequent phases. For example, the scanner is not affected by
the semantic analyzer. This separation of passes makes language tools like
syntax-directed editors relatively easy to create.)

$(OL
        $(LI $(B source character set)$(BR)

        The source file is checked to determine its encoding
        and the appropriate scanner is loaded. 7-bit ASCII and UTF
        encodings are accepted.
        )

        $(LI $(B script line) $(BR)

        If the first line starts with "$(HASH)!", then that line
        is ignored.
        )

        $(LI $(B lexical analysis)$(BR)

        The source file is divided into a sequence of tokens.
        $(DDSUBLINK spec/lex, specialtokens, Special tokens)
        are replaced with other tokens.
        $(GLINK_LEX SpecialTokenSequence)s
        are processed and removed.
        )

        $(LI $(B syntax analysis)$(BR)

        The sequence of tokens is parsed to form syntax trees.
        )

        $(LI $(B semantic analysis)$(BR)

        The syntax trees are traversed to declare variables, load symbol tables, assign
        types, and determine the meaning of the program.
        )

        $(LI $(B optimization)$(BR)

        Optimization is an optional pass that attempts to rewrite the program
        in a semantically equivalent, more performant, version.
        )

        $(LI $(B code generation)$(BR)

        Instructions are selected from the target architecture to implement
        the semantics of the program. The typical result will be
        an object file suitable for input to a linker.
        )

$(H2 $(LINK2 memory-model, Memory Model))

    $(P The $(I byte) is the fundamental unit of storage. Each byte has 8 bits and is stored at
    a unique address. A $(I memory location) is a sequence of one or more bytes of the exact size
    required to hold a scalar type. Multiple threads can access separate memory locations
    without interference.
    )

    $(P Memory locations come in three groups:)

    $(OL
    $(LI $(I Thread-local memory locations) are accessible from only one thread at a time.)
    $(LI $(I Immutable memory locations) cannot be written to during their lifetime. Immutable
    memory locations can be read from by multiple threads without synchronization.)
    $(LI $(I Shared memory locations) are accessible from multiple threads.)
    )

    $(UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR Allowing multiple threads to access a thread-local memory
    location results in undefined behavior.)

    $(UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR Writing to an immutable memory location during its lifetime
    results in undefined behavior.)

    $(UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR Writing to a shared memory location in
    one thread while one or more additional threads read from or write to the same location is
    undefined behavior unless all of the reads and writes are synchronized.)

    $(P Execution of a single thread on thread-local and immutable memory locations
    is $(I sequentially consistent). This means the collective result of the operations
    is the same as if they were executed in the same order that the operations appear in the program.
    )

    $(P A memory location can be transferred from thread-local to immutable or shared
    if there is only one reference to the location.)

    $(P A memory location can be transferred from shared to immutable or thread-local
    if there is only one reference to the location.)

    $(P A memory location can be temporarily transferred from shared to local if
    synchronization is used to prevent any other threads from accessing the memory
    location during the operation.)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 object-model, Object Model))

    $(P An $(I object) is created in the following circumstances:
    )

    $(UL
    $(LI a definition)
    $(LI a $(GLINK2 expression, NewExpression))
    $(LI a temporary is created)
    $(LI changing which field of a union is active)
    )

    $(P An object spans a sequence of memory locations which may or may not
    be contiguous. Its lifetime encompasses construction, destruction, and the period in between.
    Each object has a type which is determined either statically or by runtime
    type information.
    The object's memory locations may include any combination of thread-local, immutable, or
    shared.
    )

    $(P Objects can be composed into a $(I composed object). Objects that make up
    a composed object are $(I subobjects). An object that is not the subobject
    of another object is a $(I complete object). The lifetime of a subobject
    is always within the lifetime of the complete object to which it belongs.
    )

    $(P An object's address is the address of the first byte of the first memory
    location for that object. Object addresses are distinct unless one
    object is nested within the other.
    )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 arithmetic, Arithmetic))

    $(H3 Integer Arithmetic)

    $(P Integer arithmetic is performed using
    $(LINK2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement, two's complement) math.
    Integer overflow is not checked for.
    )

    $(H3 Floating Point Arithmetic)

    $(P Floating point arithmetic is performed using
    $(LINK2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754, IEEE-754 floating point math).)
