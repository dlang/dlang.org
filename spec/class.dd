        the compiler assigns some to registers and shuffles others around all to

        initializations, and it is not possible to read a value that has not

$(H3 $(LNAME2 anonymous, Anonymous Nested Classes))

        $(P An anonymous nested class is both defined and instantiated with
        a $(I NewAnonClassExpression):
        )

$(GRAMMAR
$(GNAME NewAnonClassExpression):
    $(D new) $(D class) $(GLINK ConstructorArgs)$(OPT) $(GLINK AnonBaseClassList)$(OPT) $(GLINK2 struct, AggregateBody)

$(GNAME ConstructorArgs):
    $(D $(LPAREN)) $(GLINK2 expression, NamedArgumentList)$(OPT) $(D $(RPAREN))

$(GNAME AnonBaseClassList):
    $(GLINK SuperClassOrInterface)
    $(GLINK SuperClassOrInterface) $(D ,) $(GLINK Interfaces)
)

which is equivalent to:

$(GRAMMAR_INFORMATIVE
$(D class) $(GLINK_LEX Identifier) $(D :) $(I AnonBaseClassList) $(I AggregateBody)
// ...
$(D new) $(I Identifier) $(I ConstructorArgs)
)

where $(I Identifier) is the name generated for the anonymous nested class.

    $(P If a $(I ClassDeclaration) has a $(D const), $(D immutable)
        or $(D shared) storage class, then it is as if each member of the class
        was declared with that storage class.
        If a base class is const, immutable or shared, then all classes derived
        from it are also const, immutable or shared.
