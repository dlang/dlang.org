        $(P Static constructors are used to initialize static class members with

        $(P Static constructors in other languages are built implicitly by using
        member
        initializers that can't be computed at compile time. The trouble with

        What values do a and b end up with, what order are the initializations

        are the values of a and b before the initializations are run, is this a
        compile error, or is this
        a runtime error? Additional confusion comes from it not being obvious if
        an initializer is
        static or dynamic.

        $(P D makes this simple. All member initializations must be determinable by
        the compiler at
        compile time, hence there is no order-of-evaluation dependency for
        member
        initializations, and it is not possible to read a value that has not
        been initialized. Dynamic
        initialization is performed by a static constructor, defined with
