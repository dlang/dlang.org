	Manifest:
	The required manifest must provide a list of all the files that are part of the
	publication (e.g. Content Documents, NCX table of contents, image files, CSS style sheets).
  Kindlegen however does not require CSS and images to be specified in the manifest if they
  are referenced from the content HTML.
	The manifest element must contain one or more item elements with the following media-type attributes:
  
  text/x-oeb1-document      HTML content files
  application/x-dtbncx+xml  NCX table of contents
  image/jpeg                JPEG image
  image/GIF                 GIF image

<!--
	Spine:
	Following manifest, there must be one and only one spine element, which contains one
	or more itemref elements. Each itemref references an document designated
	in the manifest. The order of the itemref elements organizes the associated content
	files into the linear reading order of the publication.
	
	The toc attribute refers to the id ref of the NCX file specified in the manifest.

<!--
	Guide:
	Within the package there may be one guide element, containing one or more reference elements.
	The guide element identifies fundamental structural components of the publication, to enable
	Reading Systems to provide convenient access to them.
  
  For detailed info visit: http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf/OPF_2.0_final_spec.html#Section2.6
  
  The Kindle reading system support two special guide items which are both mandatory.
  type="toc"  [mandatory]: a link to the HTML table of contents
  type="text" [mandatory]: a link to where the content of the book starts (typically after the front matter)
	
  Kindle reading platforms need both thede guid items to provide a consistent user enxperience to the user.
  
  It is good practice to include both a logical table of contents (NCX) and an HTML table of contents
  (made of hyperlinks). The NCX enables various advanced navigation features but the HTML table of
  contents can easily be discovered by the user by paging through the book. Both are useful.
