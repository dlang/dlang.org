    $(NOTE This document is under construction. Please excuse the dust and noise.)

    $(P ImportC is a C compiler embedded into the D implementation.
    Its purpose is to enable direct importation of C files, without
    needing to manually prepare a D file corresponding to the declarations
    in the C file. It enables directly compiling C files into modules, and
    linking them in with D code to form an executable. It can be used
    as a C compiler to compile and link 100% C programs.
    )

    $(P This is not a C reference manual nor programming tutorial.
    It describes the specifics of the dialect of C that
    ImportC is, and how to use it effectively.)

    $(P ImportC and $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html, BetterC) are very different.
    ImportC is an actual C compiler. BetterC is a subset of D that relies only on the
    existence of the C Standard library.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 dialect, ImportC で使える文法))

    $(P There are many versions of C. ImportC is designed to be an
    implementation of $(LINK2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision), ISO/IEC 9899:2011),
    which will hereafter be referred to as $(B C11).
    References to the C11 Standard will be C11 followed by the paragraph number.
    Prior versions, such as C99, C89, and K+R C, are not supported.
    )

    $(P Adjustment to the ImportC dialect is made to match the
    behavior of the C compiler that the D compiler is matched to
    i.e. the $(I associated C compiler).
    For example, on Win32 D is matched to the Digital Mars C compiler,
    and can be matched to the Visual C compiler using the $(TT -m32mscoff)
    switch. Win64 D is matched to the Visual C compiler.
    On Posix targets, the matching C compiler is Gnu C or Clang C.
    )

    $(P Further adjustment is made to take advantage of some of the D
    implementation's capabilities.)

    $(P This is all covered in the rest of this document.)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 command-line, ImportCを呼び出す))

    $(P The ImportC compiler can be invoked in two ways:)

    $(UL
    $(LI directly via the command line)
    $(LI indirectly via importing a C file)
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 command-line, ImportC Files on the Command Line))

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 importing, Importing C Files))


$(H2 $(LNAME2 preprocessor, プリプロセッサ))

    $(P ImportC does not have a preprocessor. It is designed to compile C
    files after they have been first run through the C preprocessor.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 spp,Digital Mars C Preprocessor sppn.exe))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/sc.html, $(TT sppn.exe)) runs on Win32 and is invoked as:)

    $(CONSOLE
    sppn file.c
    )

    $(P and the preprocessed output is written to $(TT file.i).)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 gcc-preprocessor, Gnu C プリプロセッサ))

    $(P The $(LINK2 https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html, Gnu C Preprocessor) can be invoked as:)

    $(CONSOLE
    gcc -E file.c > file.i
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 clang-preprocessor, Clang C プリプロセッサ))

    $(P The $(LINK2 https://freecompilercamp.org/clang-basics/, Clang Preprocessor) can be invoked as:)

    $(CONSOLE
    clang -E file.c > file.i
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 dmpp, dmpp C プリプロセッサ))

    $(P The $(LINK2 https://www.DigitalMars/dmpp, dmpp C Preprocessor) can be invoked as:)

    $(CONSOLE
    dmpp file.c
    )

    $(P and the preprocessed output is written to $(TT file.i).)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 predefined-macros, 定義済みマクロ))

    $(P ImportC does not predefine any macros.)

    $(BEST_PRACTICE To distinguish an ImportC compile vs some other C compiler, define
    `__IMPORTC__` to be `1` when the preprocessor is run.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 preprocessor-directives, プリプロセッサ指令))

    $(P Nevertheless, ImportC supports these preprocessor directives:)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 line-control, Line control))

    $(P C11 6.10.4)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 linemarker, ラインマーカー))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.1.0/cpp/Preprocessor-Output.html, linemarker)
    directives are normally embedded in the output of C preprocessors.)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 implementation, 実装))

    $(P The implementation defined characteristics of ImportC are:)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 enums, Enums))

    $(P $(I enumeration-constants) are always typed as `int`.)

    $(P The expression that defines the value of an $(I enumeration-constant) must
    be an integral type and evaluate to an integer value that fits in an `int`.)

    ---
    enum E { -10, 0x81231234 }; // ok
    enum F {  0x812312345678 }; // error, doesn't fit in int
    enum G { 1.0 };             // error, not integral type
    ---

    $(P The enumerated type is `int`.)


    $(H3 $(LNAME2 bitfields, ビットフィールド))

    $(P There are many implementation defined aspects of C11 bit fields.
    ImportC's behavior adjusts to match the behavior of the $(I associated
    C compiler) on the target platform.
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 implicit-function-declaration, 暗黙の関数宣言))

    $(P Implicit function declarations:)

    $(CCODE
    int main()
    {
        func();  // implicit declaration of func()
    }
    )

    $(P were allowed in K+R C and C89, but were invalidated in C99 and C11. Although many
    C compilers still support them, ImportC does not.
    )

    $(RATIONALE Implicit function declarations are very error-prone and cause hard
    to find bugs.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 limitations, 制限事項))

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 exceptions, 例外処理))

    $(P ImportC is assumed to never throw exceptions. `setjmp` and `longjmp` are not supported.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 const, Const))

    $(P C11 specifies that `const` only applies locally. `const` in ImportC applies transitively,
    meaning that although $(CCODE int *const p;) means in C11 that p is a const pointer to int,
    in ImportC it means p is a const pointer to a const int.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 volatile, Volatile))

    $(P The `volatile` type-qualifier (C11 6.7.3) is ignored. Use of `volatile` to implement shared
    memory access is unlikely to work anyway, $(LINK2 #_atomic, _Atomic) is for that.
    To use `volatile` as a device register, call a function to do it that is compiled separately,
    or use inline assembler.
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 restrict, Restrict))

    $(P The `restrict` type-qualifier (C11 6.7.3) is ignored.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 _atomic, _Atomic))

    $(P The `_Atomic` type-qualifier (C11 6.7.3) is ignored.
    To do atomic operations, use an externally compiled function for that, or the inline assembler.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 compatible_types, 互換性のある型))

    $(P $(I Compatible Types) (C11 6.7.2) are identical types in ImportC.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 same_only_different, Same only Different Types))

    $(P On some platforms, C `long` and `unsigned long` are the same size as `int` and `unsigned int`, respectively.
    On other platforms, C `long` and `unsigned long` are the same size as `long long` and `unsigned long long`.
    `long double` and `long  double _Complex` can be same size as `double` and `double _Complex`.
    In ImportC, these types that are the same size and signed-ness are treated as the same types.
    )

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 _generic, _Generic))

    $(P $(B Generic selection) expressions (C11 6.5.1.1) differ from ImportC.
    The types in $(LINK2 #same_only_different, Same only Different Types) are
    indistinguishable in the $(I type-name) parts of $(I generic-association).
    Instead of giving an error for duplicate types per C11 6.5.1.1-2, ImportC
    will select the first compatible $(I type-name) in the $(I generic-assoc-list).
    )


$(H2 $(LNAME2 extensions, 拡張機能))

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 forward-references, 前方参照))

    $(P Any declarations in scope can be accessed, not just
    declarations that lexically precede a reference.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 ctfe, コンパイル時関数実行))

    $(P Evaluating constant expressions includes executing functions in the
    same manner as D's CTFE can.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 inlining, Function Inlining))

    $(P Functions for which the function body is present can
    be inlined by ImportC as well as by the D code that calls them.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 register, ストレージクラスの登録))

    $(P Objects with `register` storage class are treated as `auto` declarations.)

    $(P Objects with `register` storage class may have their address taken. C11 6.3.2.1-2)

    $(P Arrays can have `register` storage class, and may be enregistered by the compiler. C11 6.3.2.1-3)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 gnu-clang-extensions, Gnu や Clang の拡張機能))

    $(P `gcc` and `clang` are presumed to have the same behavior w.r.t. extensions,
    so `gcc` as used here refers to both.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 noreturn, `__attribute__((noreturn))`))

    $(P `__attribute__((noreturn))` marks a function as never returning.
    `gcc` set this as an attribute of the function, it is
    not part of the function's type. In D, a function that never returns
    has the return type `noreturn`. The difference can be seen with the
    code:)
    $(CCODE
    attribute((noreturn)) int foo();
    size_t x = sizeof(foo());
    )
    $(P This code is accepted by `gcc`, but makes no sense for D. Hence,
    although it works in ImportC, it is not representable as D code,
    meaning one must use judgement in creating a .di file to interface
    with C `noreturn` functions.)

    $(P Furthermore, the D compiler takes advantage of `noreturn` functions
    by issuing compile time errors for unreachable code. Such unreachable
    code, however, is valid C11, and the ImportC compiler will accept it.)

    $(BEST_PRACTICE C code that uses the `noreturn` attribute should at the
    very least set the return type to `void`.)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 visualc-extensions, Visual C の拡張機能))


$(H2 $(LNAME2 digital-mars-extensions, Digital Mars C の拡張機能))


$(H2 $(LNAME2 d-side, Dの観点からのImportC))

    $(P There is no one-to-one mapping of C constructs to D constructs, although
    it is very close. What follows is a description of how the D side views
    the C declarations that are imported.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 module-name, モジュール名))

    $(P The module name assigned to the ImportC file is the filename stripped
    of its path and extension. This is just like the default module name assigned
    to a D module that does not have a module declaration.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 extern-C, `extern (C)`))

    $(P All C symbols are `extern (C)`.)

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 enums, 列挙型))

    $(P The C enum:)

    $(CCODE enum E { A, B = 2 };)

    $(P appears to D code as:)

    ---
    enum E : int { A, B = 2 }
    alias A = E.A;
    alias B = E.B;
    ---

    $(P The `.min` and `.max` properties are available:)

    ---
    static assert(E.min == 0 && E.max == 2);
    ---

$(H2 $(LNAME2 wrapping, Cのコードのラッピング))

    $(P Many difficulties with adapting C code to ImportC can be done without
    editing the C code itself. Wrap the C code in another C file and then
    $(CCODE #include) it. Consider the following problematic C file $(TT file.c):)

    $(CCODE
    void func(int *__restrict p);
    int S;
    struct S { int a, b; };
    )

    $(P The problems are that $(CCODE __restrict) is not a type qualifier recognized by ImportC
    (or C11),
    and the struct `S` is hidden from D by the declaration $(CCODE int S;).
    To wrap $(TT file.c) with a fix, create the file $(TT file_ic.c) with the contents:)

    $(CCODE
    #define __restrict restrict
    #include "file.c"
    typedef struct S S_t;
    )

    $(P Then, `import file_ic;` instead of `import file;`, and use `S_t` when $(CCODE struct S) is desired.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 warnings, 警告))

    $(P Many suspicious C constructs normally cause warnings to be emitted by default by
    typical compilers, such as:)

    $(CCODE int *p = 3; // Warning: integer implicitly converted to pointer)

    $(P ImportC does not emit warnings. The presumption is the user will be importing existing C
    code developed using another C compiler, and it is written as intended.
    If C11 says it is legal, ImportC accepts it.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 importcpp, C++ のインポート))

    $(P ImportC will not compile C++ code. For that, use $(TT dpp).)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 other-solutions, その他の解決策))

    $(H3 $(LNAME2 dpp, dpp by Atila Neves))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://code.dlang.org/packages/dpp/0.2.1, dpp code))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/blog/2019/04/08/project-highlight-dpp/, dpp Article))

    $(P From the Article:)

    $(BLOCKQUOTE dpp is a compiler wrapper that will parse a D source
    file with the .dpp extension and expand in place any #include directives
    it encounters, translating all of the C or C++ symbols to D, and then
    pass the result to a D compiler (DMD by default).)

    $(P Like DStep, dpp relies on libclang.)


    $(H3 $(LNAME2 dstep, DStep by Jacob Carlborg))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://code.dlang.org/packages/dstep, DStep code))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/blog/2019/04/22/dstep-1-0-0/, DStep Article))

    $(P From the Article:)

    $(BLOCKQUOTE DStep is a tool for automatically generating D
    bindings for C and Objective-C libraries. This is implemented by
    processing C or Objective-C header files and outputting D modules.
    DStep uses the Clang compiler as a library (libclang) to process the header files.)


    $(H3 $(LNAME2 htod, Walter Bright による htod))

    $(P $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/htod.html, htod) converts a C $(TT .h) file
    to a D source file, suitable for importing into D code.
    $(B htod) is built from the front end of the Digital Mars C and C++ compiler.
    It works just like a C or C++ compiler except that its output is source
    code for a D module rather than object code.)


$(H2 $(LNAME2 internals, ImportC の仕組み))

    $(P This is a description of how ImportC is implemented, intended
    to remove the mystery of various design choices.)
