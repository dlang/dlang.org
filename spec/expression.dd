$(GRAMMAR
$(GNAME Expression):
    $(GLINK CommaExpression)
)

$(P An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies an evaluation.
The syntax, order of evaluation, and semantics of expressions are as follows.)

    $(P Expressions are used to compute values with a resulting type.
        These values can then be assigned,
        tested, or ignored. Expressions can also have side effects.
    )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 definitions-and-terms, Definitions and Terms))

$(H3 $(LNAME2 .define-full-expression, Full Expression))

$(P For any expression
$(I expr), the full expression of $(I expr) is defined as follows. If $(I expr) parses as a
subexpression of another expression $(I expr$(SUBSCRIPT 1)), then the full expression of $(I expr) is the
full expression of $(I expr$(SUBSCRIPT 1)). Otherwise, $(I expr) is its own full expression.)

$(P Each expression has a unique full expression. Example:)

---
return f() + g() * 2;
---

$(P The full expression of `g() * 2` above is `f() + g() * 2`, but not the
full expression of `f() + g()` because the latter is not parsed as a subexpression.)

$(P Note: Although the definition is straightforward, a few subtleties exist related to function literals:)

---
return (() => x + f())() * g();
---

$(P The full expression of `f()` above is `x + f()`, not the expression passed
to `return`. This is because the parent of `x + f()` has function literal type, not expression type.)

$(H3 $(LNAME2 .define-lvalue, Lvalue))

$(P The following expressions, and no others, are called *lvalue expressions* or *lvalues*:)
$(OL
$(LI $(RELATIVE_LINK2 this, `this`) inside `struct` and `union` member functions;)
$(LI a variable, function name, or invocation of a function that returns by reference;)
$(LI the result of the `.` $(GLINK PostfixExpression) or
$(DDSUBLINK spec/module, module_scope_operators, Module Scope Operator)
when the rightmost side of the dot is a variable,
field (direct or `static`), function name, or invocation of a function that returns by reference;)
$(LI the result of the following expressions:
$(UL
$(LI built-in unary operators `+` (when applied to an lvalue), `*`, `++` (prefix only), `--` (prefix only);)
$(LI built-in indexing operator `[]` (but not the slicing operator);)
$(LI built-in assignment binary operators, i.e. `=`, `+=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `~=`,
`<<=`, `>>=`, `>>>=`, and `^^=`;)
$(LI the $(GLINK ConditionalExpression) operator $(I e) `?` $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 1)) `:` $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 2)) under the following
circumstances:)
$(OL
    $(LI $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 1)) and $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 2)) are lvalues of the same type; OR)
    $(LI One of $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 1)) and $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 2)) is an lvalue of type `T` and the other has
    and `alias this` converting it to `ref T`;))
$(LI $(DDLINK spec/operatoroverloading, Operator Overloading, user-defined operators)
if and only if the function called as a result of lowering returns
by reference;)
$(LI $(RELATIVE_LINK2 mixin_expressions, `mixin` expressions) if and only if the
compilation of the expression resulting from compiling
the argument(s) to `mixin` is an lvalue;)
$(LI `cast(U)` expressions applied to lvalues of type `T` when `T*` is implicitly convertible to `U*`;)
$(LI `cast()` and `cast(`$(I qualifier list)`)` when applied to an lvalue.)
)))

$(H3 $(LNAME2 .define-rvalue, Rvalue))

$(P Expressions that are not lvalues are *rvalues*. Rvalues include all literals, special value keywords such as `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`,
`enum` values, and the result of expressions not defined as lvalues above.)

$(P The built-in address-of operator (unary `&`) may only be applied to lvalues.)

$(H3 $(LNAME2 .define-smallest-short-circuit, Smallest Short-Circuit Expression))

$(P Given an expression $(I expr) that is a subexpression of a full
expression $(I fullexpr), the *smallest short-circuit expression*, if any, is the shortest
subexpression $(I scexpr) of $(I fullexpr) that is an $(GLINK AndAndExpression) (`&&`) or an
$(GLINK OrOrExpression) (`||`), such that $(I expr) is a subexpression of $(I scexpr). Example:)
---
((f() * 2 && g()) + 1) || h()
---
The smallest short-circuit expression
of the subexpression `f() * 2` above is `f() * 2 && g()`. Example:
---
(f() && g()) + h()
---
The subexpression `h()` above has no smallest short-circuit expression.

$(H2 $(LNAME2 order-of-evaluation, Order Of Evaluation))

$(P Built-in prefix unary expressions `++` and `--` are evaluated as if lowered (rewritten) to
$(RELATIVE_LINK2 assignment_operator_expressions, assignments) as follows:)

$(TABLE
    $(THEAD Expression, Equivalent)
    $(TROW `++expr`, `((expr) += 1)`)
    $(TROW `--expr`, `((expr) -= 1)`)
)
$(P
Therefore, the result of prefix `++` and `--` is the lvalue after the side effect has been
effected.)

$(P Built-in postfix unary expressions `++` and `--` are evaluated as if lowered (rewritten) to
$(DDSUBLINK spec/expression, function_literals, lambda)
invocations as follows:)

$(TABLE
    $(THEAD Expression, Equivalent)
    $(TROW `expr++`, `(ref x){auto t = x; ++x; return t;}(expr)`)
    $(TROW `expr--`, `(ref x){auto t = x; --x; return t;}(expr)`)
)
$(P Therefore, the result of postfix
`++` and `--` is an rvalue just before the side effect has been effected.)

$(P Binary expressions except for $(GLINK AssignExpression), $(GLINK OrOrExpression), and
$(GLINK AndAndExpression) are evaluated in lexical order (left-to-right). Example:)

$(SPEC_RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE_RUN
-------------
int i = 2;
i = ++i * i++ + i;
assert(i == 3 * 3 + 4);
-------------
)

$(P $(GLINK OrOrExpression) and $(GLINK AndAndExpression) evaluate their left-hand side argument
first. Then, $(GLINK OrOrExpression) evaluates its right-hand side if and only if its left-hand
side does not evaluate to nonzero. $(GLINK AndAndExpression) evaluates its right-hand side if and
only if its left-hand side evaluates to nonzero.)

$(P $(GLINK ConditionalExpression) evaluates its left-hand side argument
first. Then, if the result is nonzero, the second operand is evaluated. Otherwise, the third operand
is evaluated.)

$(P Calls to functions  with `extern(D)` $(DDSUBLINK spec/attribute, linkage, linkage) (which is
the default linkage) are evaluated in the following order: first, if necessary, the address of the
function to call is evaluated (e.g. in the case of a computed function pointer or delegate). Then,
arguments are evaluated left to right. Finally, transfer is passed to the function. Example:)

$(SPEC_RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE_COMPILE
---
import std.stdio;
void function(int a, int b, int c) fun()
{
    writeln("fun() called");
    static void r(int a, int b, int c) { writeln("callee called"); }
    return &r;
}
int f1() { writeln("f1() called"); return 1; }
int f2() { writeln("f2() called"); return 2; }
int f3(int x) { writeln("f3() called"); return x + 3; }
int f4() { writeln("f4() called"); return 4; }
// evaluates fun() then f1() then f2() then f3() then f4()
// after which control is transferred to the callee
fun()(f1(), f3(f2()), f4());
---
)

    $(IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED
    $(OL
    $(LI The order of evaluation of the operands of $(GLINK AssignExpression).)
    $(LI The order of evaluation of function arguments for functions with linkage other than `extern (D)`.)
    ))

    $(BEST_PRACTICE Even though the order of evaluation is well-defined, writing code that
    depends on it is rarely recommended.)

$(H2 $(LNAME2 temporary-lifetime, Lifetime of Temporaries))

$(P Expressions and statements may create and/or consume rvalues. Such values are called
$(I temporaries) and do not have a name or a visible scope. Their lifetime is managed automatically
as defined in this section.)

$(P For each evaluation that yields a temporary value, the lifetime of that temporary begins at the
evaluation point, similarly to creation of a usual named value initialized with an expression.)

$(P Termination of lifetime of temporaries does not obey the customary scoping rules and is defined
as follows:)

$(UL
$(LI If:
$(OL $(LI the full expression has a smallest short-circuit expression $(I expr); and)
$(LI the temporary is created on the right-hand side of the `&&` or `||` operator; and)
$(LI the right-hand side is evaluated,))
then temporary destructors are evaluated right after the right-hand side
expression has been evaluated and converted to `bool`. Evaluation of destructors proceeds in
reverse order of construction.)

$(LI For all other cases, the temporaries generated for the purpose of invoking functions are
deferred to the end of the full expression. The order of destruction is inverse to the order of
construction.))

$(P If a subexpression of an expression throws an exception, all temporaries created up to the
evaluation of that subexpression will be destroyed per the rules above. No destructor calls will
be issued for temporaries not yet constructed.)

$(P Note: An intuition behind these rules is that destructors of temporaries are deferred to the end of full
expression and in reverse order of construction, with the exception that the right-hand side of
`&&` and `||` are considered their own full expressions even when part of larger expressions.)

$(P Note: The $(GLINK ConditionalExpression) $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 1) ? e$(SUBSCRIPT 2) : e$(SUBSCRIPT 3)) is not
a special case although it evaluates expressions conditionally: $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 1)) and one of
$(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 2)) and $(I e$(SUBSCRIPT 3)) may create temporaries. Their destructors are inserted
to the end of the full expression in the reverse order of creation.)

$(P Example:)

$(SPEC_RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE_COMPILE
---
import std.stdio;
struct S
{
    int x;
    this(int n) { x = n; writefln("S(%s)", x); }
    ~this() { writefln("~S(%s)", x); }
}
bool b = (S(1) == S(2) || S(3) != S(4)) && S(5) == S(6);
---
)

The output of the code above is:

$(CONSOLE
S(1)
S(2)
S(3)
S(4)
~S(4)
~S(3)
S(5)
S(6)
~S(6)
~S(5)
~S(2)
~S(1)
)

First, `S(1)` and `S(2)` are evaluated in lexical order. Per the rules, they will be destroyed at
the end of the full expression and in reverse order. The comparison $(D S(1) == S(2)) yields
`false`, so the right-hand side of the `||` is evaluated causing `S(3)` and `S(4)` to be evaluated,
also in lexical order. However, their destruction is not deferred to the end of the full
expression. Instead, `S(4)` and then `S(3)` are destroyed at the end of the `||` expression.
Following their destruction, `S(5)` and `S(6)` are constructed in lexical order. Again they are not
destroyed at the end of the full expression, but right at the end of the `&&` expression.
Consequently, the destruction of `S(6)` and `S(5)` is carried before that of `S(2)` and `S(1)`.
