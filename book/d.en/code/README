This directory contains most of the code samples that appear in the book
"Programming in D":

  http://ddili.org/

The names of the sample programs are in chapterName.N.d format. The programs
are extracted from the chapter files and named automatically.

  chapterName - The name of the chapter file without the .html extension, from
                which the program was extracted (e.g. hello_world for
                hello_world.html)

  N           - The order in which the program was extracted from that chapter
                file (e.g. 1)

For example, hello_world.1.d is the first program that was extracted from
hello_world.html.

The word 'cozum' (transliteration of Turkish "çözüm") that appears in some of
the chapter file names has been replaced with its English translation
(solution). Accordingly, unit_testing.solution.2.d is the second program that
was extracted from unit_testing.cozum.html.
