/*
Source file for statement.svg and statement.eps. The
commands to run (assuming graphviz is installed) are:

cd /path/to/dlang.org/images
dot -Tsvg statement.dot >statement.svg
dot -Teps statement.dot >statement.eps

These commands are not part of the makefile because the files are fairly stable
and so as to not make the build depending on graphviz being installed.
