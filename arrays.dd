$(SPEC_S Arrays,

    $(P There are four kinds of arrays:)

    $(TABLE2 Kinds of Arrays,
        $(THEAD Syntax, Description)
        $(TROW $(ARGS $(I type)*), $(ARGS $(RELATIVE_LINK2 pointers, Pointers to data)))
        $(TROW $(ARGS $(I type)[$(I integer)]), $(ARGS $(RELATIVE_LINK2 static-arrays, Static arrays)))
        $(TROW $(ARGS $(I type)[]),  $(ARGS $(RELATIVE_LINK2 dynamic-arrays, Dynamic arrays)))
        $(TROW $(ARGS $(I type)[$(I type)]), $(ARGS $(DDLINK hash-map, Associative Arrays, Associative arrays)))
    )

$(H4 $(LNAME2 pointers, Pointers))

---------
int* p;
---------

        $(P These are simple pointers to data, analogous to C pointers.
        Pointers are provided for interfacing with C and for
        specialized systems work.
        There
        is no length associated with it, and so there is no way for the
        compiler or runtime to do bounds checking, etc., on it.
        Most conventional uses for pointers can be replaced with
        dynamic arrays, $(D out) and $(D ref) parameters,
        and reference types.
        )

$(H4 $(LNAME2 static-arrays, Static Arrays))

---------
int[3] s;
---------

        $(P These are analogous to C arrays. Static arrays are distinguished
        by having a length fixed at compile time.
        )

        $(P The total size of a static array cannot exceed 16Mb.
        A dynamic array should be used instead for such large arrays.
        )

        $(P A static array with a dimension of 0 is allowed, but no
        space is allocated for it. It's useful as the last member
        of a variable length struct, or as the degenerate case of
        a template expansion.
        )


        $(P Static arrays are value types. Unlike in C and D version 1,
        static arrays are passed to functions by value.
        Static arrays can also be returned by functions.
        )


$(H4 $(LNAME2 dynamic-arrays, Dynamic Arrays))

---------
int[] a;
---------

        $(P Dynamic arrays consist of a length and a pointer to the array data.
        Multiple dynamic arrays can share all or parts of the array data.
        )

$(H2 Array Declarations)

        $(P There are two ways to declare arrays, prefix and postfix.
        The prefix form is the preferred method, especially for
        non-trivial types.
        )

$(H3 Prefix Array Declarations)

        $(P Prefix declarations appear before the identifier being
        declared and read right to left, so:
        )

---------
int[] a;      // dynamic array of ints
int[4][3] b;  // array of 3 arrays of 4 ints each
int[][5] c;   // array of 5 dynamic arrays of ints.
int*[]*[3] d; // array of 3 pointers to dynamic arrays of pointers to ints
int[]* e;     // pointer to dynamic array of ints
---------


$(H3 Postfix Array Declarations)

        $(P Postfix declarations appear after the identifier being
        declared and read left to right.
        Each group lists equivalent declarations:
        )

---------
// dynamic array of ints
int[] a;
int a[];

// array of 3 arrays of 4 ints each
int[4][3] b;
int[4] b[3];
int b[3][4];

// array of 5 dynamic arrays of ints.
int[][5] c;
int[] c[5];
int c[5][];

// array of 3 pointers to dynamic arrays of pointers to ints
int*[]*[3] d;
int*[]* d[3];
int* (*d[3])[];

// pointer to dynamic array of ints
int[]* e;
int (*e)[];
---------

        $(P $(B Rationale:) The postfix form matches the way arrays are
        declared in C and C++, and supporting this form provides an
        easy migration path for programmers used to it.
        )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 usage, Array Usage))

        $(P There are two broad kinds of operations to do on an array -
        affecting
        the handle to the array,
        and affecting the contents of the array.
        C only has
        operators to affect the handle. In D, both are accessible.
        )

        $(P The handle to an array is specified by naming the array, as
        in p, s or a:
        )

---------
int* p;
int[3] s;
int[] a;

int* q;
int[3] t;
int[] b;

p = q;     // p points to the same thing q does.
p = s.ptr; // p points to the first element of the array s.
p = a.ptr; // p points to the first element of the array a.

s = ...;   // error, since s is a compiled in static
           // reference to an array.

a = p;     // error, since the length of the array pointed
           // to by p is unknown
a = s;     // a is initialized to point to the s array
a = b;     // a points to the same array as b does
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 slicing, Slicing))

        $(P $(I Slicing) an array means to specify a subarray of it.
        An array slice does not copy the data, it is only another
        reference to it.
        For example:
        )

---------
int[10] a;   // declare array of 10 ints
int[] b;

b = a[1..3]; // a[1..3] is a 2 element array consisting of
             // a[1] and a[2]
foo(b[1]);   // equivalent to foo(0)
a[2] = 3;
foo(b[1]);   // equivalent to foo(3)
---------

        $(P The [] is shorthand for a slice of the entire array.
        For example, the assignments to b:
        )

---------
int[10] a;
int[] b;

b = a;
b = a[];
b = a[0 .. a.length];
---------

        $(P are all semantically equivalent.
        )

        $(P Slicing
        is not only handy for referring to parts of other arrays,
        but for converting pointers into bounds-checked arrays:
        )

---------
int* p;
int[] b = p[0..8];
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-copying, Array Copying))

        $(P When the slice operator appears as the lvalue of an assignment
        expression, it means that the contents of the array are the
        target of the assignment rather than a reference to the array.
        Array copying happens when the lvalue is a slice, and the rvalue
        is an array of or pointer to the same type.
        )

---------
int[3] s;
int[3] t;

s[] = t;           // the 3 elements of t[3] are copied into s[3]
s[] = t[];         // the 3 elements of t[3] are copied into s[3]
s[1..2] = t[0..1]; // same as s[1] = t[0]
s[0..2] = t[1..3]; // same as s[0] = t[1], s[1] = t[2]
s[0..4] = t[0..4]; // error, only 3 elements in s
s[0..2] = t;       // error, different lengths for lvalue and rvalue
---------

$(H3 $(LNAME2 overlapping-copying, Overlapping Copying))

        $(P Overlapping copies are an error:)

---------
s[0..2] = s[1..3]; // error, overlapping copy
s[1..3] = s[0..2]; // error, overlapping copy
---------

        $(P Disallowing overlapping makes it possible for more aggressive
        parallel code optimizations than possible with the serial
        semantics of C.
        )
        
        $(P If overlapping is required, use $(FULL_XREF algorithm, copy):
        )

---------
import std.algorithm;
int[] s = [1, 2, 3, 4];

copy(s[1..3], s[0..2]);
assert(s == [2, 3, 3, 4]);
---------


$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-setting, Array Setting))

        $(P If a slice operator appears as the lvalue of an assignment
        expression, and the type of the rvalue is the same as the element
        type of the lvalue, then the lvalue's array contents
        are set to the rvalue.
        )

---------
int[3] s;
int* p;

s[] = 3;     // same as s[0] = 3, s[1] = 3, s[2] = 3
p[0..2] = 3; // same as p[0] = 3, p[1] = 3
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-concatenation, Array Concatenation))

        $(P The binary operator ~ is the $(I cat) operator. It is used
        to concatenate arrays:
        )

---------
int[] a;
int[] b;
int[] c;

a = b ~ c; // Create an array from the concatenation
           // of the b and c arrays
---------

        $(P Many languages overload the + operator to mean concatenation.
        This confusingly leads to, does:
        )

---------
"10" + 3 + 4
---------

        $(P produce the number 17, the string "1034" or the string "107" as the
        result? It isn't obvious, and the language designers wind up carefully
        writing rules to disambiguate it - rules that get incorrectly
        implemented, overlooked, forgotten, and ignored. It's much better to
        have + mean addition, and a separate operator to be array
        concatenation.
        )

        $(P Similarly, the ~= operator means append, as in:
        )

---------
a ~= b; // a becomes the concatenation of a and b
---------

        $(P Concatenation always creates a copy of its operands, even
        if one of the operands is a 0 length array, so:
        )

---------
a = b;           // a refers to b
a = b ~ c[0..0]; // a refers to a copy of b
---------

        $(P Appending does not always create a copy, see $(RELATIVE_LINK2 resize,
        setting dynamic array length) for details.
        )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-operations, Array Operations))

        $(P Many array operations, also known as vector operations,
        can be expressed at a high level rather than as a loop.
        For example, the loop:
        )

---
T[] a, b;
...
for (size_t i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
    a[i] = b[i] + 4;
---

        $(P assigns to the elements of $(CODE a) the elements of $(CODE b)
        with $(CODE 4) added to each. This can also be expressed in
        vector notation as:
        )

---
T[] a, b;
...
a[] = b[] + 4;
---

        $(P A vector operation is indicated by the slice operator appearing
        as the lvalue of an =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=, $(AMP)= or |= operator.
        The rvalue can be an expression consisting either of an array
        slice of the same length and type as the lvalue or an expression
        of the element type of the lvalue, in any combination.
        The operators supported for vector operations are the binary
        operators +, -, *, /, %, ^, $(AMP) and |, and the unary operators
        - and ~.
        )

        $(P The lvalue slice and any rvalue slices must not overlap.
        The vector assignment operators are evaluated right to left,
        and the other binary operators are evaluated left to right.
        All operands are evaluated exactly once, even if the array slice
        has zero elements in it.
        )

        $(P The order in which the array elements are computed
        is implementation defined, and may even occur in parallel.
        An application must not depend on this order.
        )

        $(P Implementation note: many of the more common vector
        operations are expected to take advantage of any vector
        math instructions available on the target computer.
        )

$(H2 $(LNAME2 pointer-arithmetic, Pointer Arithmetic))

---------
int[3] abc;              // static array of 3 ints
int[] def = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; // dynamic array of 3 ints

void dibb(int* array)
{
    array[2];     // means same thing as *(array + 2)
    *(array + 2); // get 3rd element
}

void diss(int[] array)
{
    array[2];     // ok
    *(array + 2); // error, array is not a pointer
}

void ditt(int[3] array)
{
    array[2];     // ok
    *(array + 2); // error, array is not a pointer
}
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 rectangular-arrays, Rectangular Arrays))

        $(P Experienced FORTRAN numerics programmers know that multidimensional
        "rectangular" arrays for things like matrix operations are much faster than trying to
        access them via pointers to pointers resulting from "array of pointers to array" semantics.
        For example, the D syntax:
        )

---------
double[][] matrix;
---------

        $(P declares matrix as an array of pointers to arrays. (Dynamic arrays are implemented as
        pointers to the array data.) Since the arrays can have varying sizes (being dynamically
        sized), this is sometimes called "jagged" arrays. Even worse for optimizing the code, the
        array rows can sometimes point to each other! Fortunately, D static arrays, while using
        the same syntax, are implemented as a fixed rectangular layout:
        )

---------
double[3][3] matrix;
---------

        $(P declares a rectangular matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns, all contiguously in memory. In
        other languages, this would be called a multidimensional array and be declared as:
        )
---------
double matrix[3,3];
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-length, Array Length))


        $(P Within the [ ] of a static or a dynamic array,
        the symbol $(D $)
        represents the length of the array.
        )


---------
int[4] foo;
int[]  bar = foo;
int*   p = &foo[0];

// These expressions are equivalent:
bar[]
bar[0 .. 4]
bar[0 .. $]
bar[0 .. bar.length]


p[0 .. $]      // '$' is not defined, since p is not an array
bar[0]+$            // '$' is not defined, out of scope of [ ]

bar[$-1] // retrieves last element of the array
---------

$(H2 $(LNAME2 array-properties, Array Properties))

        $(P For the $(D .sort) property to work on arrays of class
        objects, the class definition must define the function:
        $(D int opCmp(Object)). This is used to determine the
        ordering of the class objects. Note that the parameter
        is of type $(D Object), not the type of the class.)

        $(P For the $(D .sort) property to work on arrays of
        structs or unions, the struct or union definition must
        define the function:

        $(D int opCmp(ref const S) const).

        The type $(D S) is the type of the struct or union.
        This function will determine the sort ordering.
        )

    $(P Examples:)

---------
int* p;
int[3] s;
int[] a;

p.length; // error, length not known for pointer
s.length; // compile time constant 3
a.length; // runtime value

p.dup;    // error, length not known
s.dup;    // creates an array of 3 elements, copies
          // elements s into it
a.dup;    // creates an array of a.length elements, copies
          // elements of a into it
---------

$(H3 $(LNAME2 resize, Setting Dynamic Array Length))

        $(P The $(D .length) property of a dynamic array can be set
        as the lvalue of an = operator:
        )

---------
array.length = 7;
---------

        $(P This causes the array to be reallocated in place, and the existing
        contents copied over to the new array. If the new array length is
        shorter, the array is not reallocated, and no data is copied.  It is
        equivalent to slicing the array:)

---------
array = array[0..7];
---------

        $(P If the new array length is longer, the remainder is filled out with the
        default initializer.
        )

        $(P To maximize efficiency, the runtime always tries to resize the
        array in place to avoid extra copying.

        It will always do a copy if the new size is larger and the array
        was not allocated via the new operator or resizing in place would
        overwrite valid data in the array.
        )



        For example:

---------
char[] a = new char[20];
char[] b = a[0..10];
char[] c = a[10..20];
char[] d = a;

b.length = 15; // always reallocates because extending in place would
               // overwrite other data in a.
b[11] = 'x';   // a[11] and c[1] are not affected

d.length = 1;
d.length = 20; // also reallocates, because doing this will overwrite a and
               // c

c.length = 12; // may reallocate in place if space allows, because nothing
               // was allocated after c.
c[5] = 'y';    // may affect contents of a, but not b or d because those
               // were reallocated.

a.length = 25; // This always reallocates because if c extended in place,
               // then extending a would overwrite c.  If c didn't
               // reallocate in place, it means there was not enough space,
               // which will still be true for a.
a[15] = 'z';   // does not affect c, because either a or c has reallocated.
---------


        $(P To guarantee copying behavior, use the .dup property to ensure
        a unique array that can be resized. Also, one may use the phobos
        $(D .capacity) property to determine how many elements can be appended
        to the array without reallocating.
        )

        $(P These issues also apply to appending arrays with the ~= operator.
        Concatenation using the ~ operator is not affected since it always
        reallocates.

        For example, when gathering user
        input from the console - it's unlikely to be longer than 80.

        function to pre-allocate array data to use with the append operator.)

$(H3 $(LNAME2 func-as-property, Functions as Array Properties))

$(H2 $(LNAME2 bounds, Array Bounds Checking))

        $(P It is an error to index an array with an index that is less than

        The rest of the arguments to printf, however, are variadic
        (specified by ...),

$(H3 Void Arrays)

    $(P There is a special type of array which acts as a wildcard that can hold
    arrays of any kind, declared as $(D void[]). Void arrays are used for
    low-level operations where some kind of array data is being handled, but
    the exact type of the array elements are unimportant. The $(D .length) of a
    void array is the length of the data in bytes, rather than the number of
    elements in its original type. Array indices in indexing and slicing
    operations are interpreted as byte indices.)

    $(P Arrays of any type can be implicitly converted to a void array; the
    compiler inserts the appropriate calculations so that the $(D .length) of
    the resulting array's size is in bytes rather than number of elements. Void
    arrays cannot be converted back to the original type without using a cast,
    and it is an error to convert to an array type whose element size does not
    evenly divide the length of the void array.)

---------
void main()
{
    int[] data1 = [1,2,3];
    long[] data2;

    void[] arr = data1;            // OK, int[] implicit converts to void[].
    assert(data1.length == 3);
    assert(arr.length == 12);      // length is implicitly converted to bytes.

    //data1 = arr;                 // Illegal: void[] does not implicitly
                                   // convert to int[].
    int[] data3 = cast(int[]) arr; // OK, can convert with explicit cast.
    data2 = cast(long[]) arr;      // Runtime error: long.sizeof == 8, which
                                   // does not divide arr.length, which is 12
                                   // bytes.
}
---------

    $(P Void arrays can also be static if their length is known at
    compile-time. The length is specified in bytes:)

---------
void main()
{
    byte[2] x;
    int[2] y;

    void[2] a = x; // OK, lengths match
    void[2] b = y; // Error: int[2] is 8 bytes long, doesn't fit in 2 bytes.
}
---------

    $(P While it may seem that void arrays are just fancy syntax for
    $(D ubyte[]), there is a subtle distinction. The garbage collector
    generally will not scan $(D ubyte[]) arrays for pointers, $(D ubyte[])
    being presumed to contain only pure byte data, not pointers. However, it
    $(I will) scan $(D void[]) arrays for pointers, since such an array may
    have been implicitly converted from an array of pointers or an array of
    elements that contain pointers.  Allocating an array that contains pointers
    as $(D ubyte[]) may run the risk of the GC collecting live memory if these
    pointers are the only remaining references to their targets.)
