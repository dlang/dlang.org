$(H2 Visual Studio Debugger)

$(P Thanks to $(LINK2 http://www.dsource.org/projects/cv2pdb, cv2pdb), debugging in Visual Studio integrates well.
Here is an example debugging session)

$(P Using cv2pdb has a few quirks, like displaying '@' instead of '.'. This is happening because the C++ debugger 
that comes with Visual Studio is used and it is confused if there is a '.' in a symbol name.)

$(H3 Exceptions)

$(P As of version 0.3.21, the installer adds an entry "D Exception" to the list of Win32 exceptions that 
can be found in the Debug->Exceptions dialog. This allows the debugger to stop execution when an exception 
is thrown by the debuggee. With earlier versions, you'll have to add an entry with code 0xE0440001 yourself.)


$(H2 Mago Debugger)

$(P As of version 0.3.16 Visual D comes with the option to install the 
$(LINK2 http://www.dsource.org/projects/mago_debugger, Mago debugger). This debug engine is dedicated to the 
D programming language and avoids the work-arounds needed when using the native debug engine. It also
features D specific expressions like dynamic array slicing.)

$(P To enable debugging with the Mago debugger select it on the project configuration page "Debugging". 
This will also disable cv2pdb conversion as Mago directly operates on the debug info emitted by DMD.)

$(P Please note that Mago is under development and might lack a few features that you find in the native debugger.)

$(H3 Exceptions with Mago)

$(P Mago displays exceptions thrown by the debuggee in the output window. You can also stop execution 
by enabling the respective box in the Debug->Exception dialog. Due to a bug, you currently cannot 
simply enable the "D Exceptions" entry, but must select the specific exceptions while keeping the 
"D Exceptions" entry unchecked. So, the dialog should look something like this:)

$(H2 Visual Studio 2012)

Visual Studio 2012 introduced a new debug engine that loses some of the capabilities of the
preceding debug engine. This includes displaying variables in the Watch Window. You
can switch back to the old debug engine by going to Tools->Options and then under the debugger 
settings, turn on native edit and continue. This will also reenable the visualizer macros in autoexp.dat.
