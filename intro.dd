$(SPEC_S Introduction,

        $(P The D programming language is a general purpose systems programming language.
        To that end, a D program is a collection of modules that can be compiled separately
        to native code that is combined with libraries and compiled C code by a linker to create a
        native executable.
        )

<h3>Phases of Compilation</h3>

        The process of compiling is divided into multiple phases. Each phase
        has no dependence on subsequent phases. For example, the scanner is
        not perturbed by the semantic analyzer. This separation of the passes
        makes language tools like syntax
        directed editors relatively easy to produce.
        It also is possible to compress D source by storing it in
        $(SINGLEQUOTE tokenized) form.

$(OL
        $(LI $(B source character set)$(BR)

        The source file is checked to see what character set it is,
        and the appropriate scanner is loaded. ASCII and UTF
        formats are accepted.
        )

        $(LI $(B script line) $(BR)

        If the first line starts with $(GREEN #!) then the first line
        is ignored.
        )

        $(LI $(B lexical analysis)$(BR)

        The source file is divided up into a sequence of tokens.
        $(EBOOK $(LINK2 #specialtokens, Special tokens))
        $(WEB $(LINK2 lex.html#specialtokens, Special tokens))
        are replaced with other tokens.
        $(GLINK2 lex, SpecialTokenSequence)s
        are processed and removed.
        )

        $(LI $(B syntax analysis)$(BR)

        The sequence of tokens is parsed to form syntax trees.
        )

        $(LI $(B semantic analysis)$(BR)

        The syntax trees are traversed to declare variables, load symbol tables, assign
        types, and in general determine the meaning of the program.
        )

        $(LI $(B optimization)$(BR)

        Optimization is an optional pass that tries to rewrite the program
        in a semantically equivalent, but faster executing, version.
        )

        $(LI $(B code generation)$(BR)

        Instructions are selected from the target architecture to implement
        the semantics of the program. The typical result will be
        an object file, suitable for input to a linker.
